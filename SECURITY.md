# Security Policy

## üîí CIRO Network Security Commitment

CIRO Network takes security seriously. We value the security research community
and believe that responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities helps us
ensure the security and privacy of our users.

## üõ°Ô∏è Supported Versions

We actively maintain security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| 0.1.x   | ‚úÖ Yes    |
| < 0.1   | ‚ùå No     |

## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

### Responsible Disclosure Process

If you discover a security vulnerability, we encourage you to let us know right
away. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix
the problem.

### How to Report

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them using one of the following methods:

#### 1. GitHub Security Advisories (Preferred)

- Navigate to the
  [Security tab](https://github.com/ciro-ai-labs/ciro-network/security/advisories)
  of this repository
- Click "Report a vulnerability"
- Fill out the advisory form with details about the vulnerability

#### 2. Email

- Send an email to: **<security@ciro.ai>**
- Use the subject line: `[SECURITY] Vulnerability Report - CIRO Network`
- Include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line

#### 3. Encrypted Communication

For sensitive reports, you can use our PGP key:

```
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
[PGP Key would be included here in a real implementation]
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site
  scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the manifestation of the
  vulnerability
- **Location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Special configuration required** to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact of the vulnerability**, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within **48 hours** and
will strive to keep you informed of our progress.

Our typical response timeline:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Triage and Validation**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Development**: Varies based on complexity
- **Public Disclosure**: Coordinated with reporter

## üîç Security Testing

### Automated Security Scanning

We employ multiple automated security testing tools:

- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: CodeQL analysis in CI/CD
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular audits with `cargo audit` and Dependabot
- **Secret Scanning**: GitHub secret scanning enabled
- **Container Scanning**: Docker image vulnerability scans
- **Infrastructure as Code Scanning**: Terraform/Docker security analysis

### Manual Security Reviews

- Code reviews include security considerations
- Regular security architecture reviews
- Penetration testing for major releases
- Third-party security audits for critical components

## üèÖ Security Hall of Fame

We recognize security researchers who help improve our security:

_Security researchers who have responsibly disclosed vulnerabilities will be
listed here with their permission._

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Development Lifecycle

### Secure Development Practices

1. **Threat Modeling**: Regular threat modeling sessions for new features
2. **Secure Coding Standards**: Following OWASP guidelines and secure coding
   practices
3. **Code Reviews**: Security-focused code reviews for all changes
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive security testing including fuzz testing
5. **Deployment**: Secure deployment practices with least privilege principles

### Security Training

All contributors are encouraged to:

- Follow secure coding guidelines in `docs/security/secure-coding.md`
- Participate in security training sessions
- Stay updated on security best practices for Rust, Cairo, and Web3

## üîê Data Protection and Privacy

### Data Minimization

- We collect only necessary data for functionality
- Personal data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- Regular data audits and cleanup processes

### Cryptographic Standards

- **Encryption**: AES-256 for symmetric encryption
- **Key Exchange**: ECDH with P-256 curves
- **Signatures**: Ed25519 for digital signatures
- **Hashing**: SHA-256 for integrity checks
- **Random Generation**: Cryptographically secure random number generators

## üöÄ Security in Deployment

### Infrastructure Security

- **Network Security**: Firewalls, VPNs, and network segmentation
- **Access Control**: Multi-factor authentication and role-based access
- **Monitoring**: 24/7 security monitoring and alerting
- **Backup Security**: Encrypted backups with tested recovery procedures

### Operational Backups and Keys

- Sensitive artifacts (keystores and account configs) are excluded from Git via `.gitignore` and backed up locally.
- Use `scripts/backup_artifacts.sh` to snapshot:
  - `contracts.json` with canonical contract addresses
  - deployment JSONs and logs in `cairo-contracts/`
  - keystores and account files under `cairo-contracts/` and `admin_accounts/`
  - airdrop artifacts (recipients, generated accounts, keystores)
- Backups are stored under `CIRO_Network_Backup/<timestamp>/`. Keep an external offline copy as needed.
- For rotation: create a new admin account, update on-chain admin via timelock/admin function, update `contracts.json`, re-run the backup script.

### Smart Contract Security

- **Audit Requirements**: All smart contracts undergo security audits
- **Formal Verification**: Critical contracts use formal verification methods
- **Gradual Rollouts**: Phased deployments with extensive testing
- **Bug Bounty Program**: Incentivizing security research on deployed contracts

## üåê Third-Party Dependencies

### Dependency Management

- Regular updates to dependencies with security patches
- Automated scanning for known vulnerabilities
- Evaluation of new dependencies for security implications
- Minimal dependency principle to reduce attack surface

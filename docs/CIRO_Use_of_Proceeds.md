# CIRO Network Seed Round Use of Proceeds

## $500,000 Funding Allocation Breakdown

### **Executive Use-of-Proceeds Summary**

CIRO Network's $500,000 seed round will be strategically allocated across five critical areas to achieve mainnet launch and initial market traction. **45% ($225,000) will fund core engineering** including smart contract development, tokenomics implementation, and simulator hardening by a team of 3 senior Solidity developers and 2 protocol architects. **25% ($125,000) will establish liquidity infrastructure** through protocol-owned liquidity seeding, initial DEX pairs, and market maker partnerships essential for the revenue→burn mechanism. **15% ($75,000) will secure top-tier security audits** with deposits for Trail of Bits design review and Zellic penetration testing, ensuring institutional-grade security before public launch. **10% ($50,000) will execute go-to-market pilots** with the first 10 enterprise GPU hosts, validating product-market fit and bootstrapping network effects. **5% ($25,000) will maintain legal and compliance reserves** for regulatory guidance, intellectual property protection, and international structuring as CIRO scales globally.

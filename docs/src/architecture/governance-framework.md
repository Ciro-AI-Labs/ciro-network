# Governance and Upgradability Framework

## Overview

The CIRO Network governance and upgradability framework provides a comprehensive, secure, and job-aware system for managing protocol upgrades and community governance. This framework is specifically designed for DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) applications where active computational jobs must be considered during upgrades.

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Governance System

- **Tiered Proposal System**: Different proposal types with varying requirements
- **Voting Power Calculation**: Multi-factor voting power based on tokens, stakes, reputation, and resource contributions
- **Delegation**: Vote delegation with automatic power tracking
- **Timelock**: Configurable delays for different proposal types
- **Emergency Controls**: Multi-signature emergency actions

#### 2. Upgradability Patterns

- **UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard)**: Gas-efficient upgrades with implementation control
- **Transparent Proxy**: Admin-controlled upgrades with function selector isolation
- **Diamond Proxy**: Multi-facet proxy for modular upgrades
- **Job-Aware Upgrades**: Upgrade scheduling that considers active computational jobs

#### 3. Security Features

- **Multi-layer Authorization**: Role-based access control with emergency overrides
- **Upgrade Validation**: Comprehensive pre-upgrade checks and compatibility validation
- **State Migration**: Automated storage layout migration for complex upgrades
- **Rollback Mechanisms**: Emergency rollback capabilities for failed upgrades

## Governance Model

### Proposal Types

#### Emergency Proposals

- **Voting Period**: 1 hour
- **Timelock**: None (immediate execution)
- **Quorum**: 10% of total voting power
- **Authorization**: Emergency council or multi-signature wallet only
- **Use Cases**: Critical security fixes, exploit mitigation

#### Critical Proposals

- **Voting Period**: 24 hours
- **Timelock**: 24 hours
- **Quorum**: 20% of total voting power
- **Authorization**: Standard proposal threshold
- **Use Cases**: Important protocol changes, security updates

#### Standard Proposals

- **Voting Period**: 7 days
- **Timelock**: 7 days
- **Quorum**: 25% of total voting power
- **Authorization**: Standard proposal threshold
- **Use Cases**: General protocol improvements, feature additions

#### Parameter Proposals

- **Voting Period**: 3 days
- **Timelock**: 3 days
- **Quorum**: 16.7% of total voting power
- **Authorization**: Standard proposal threshold
- **Use Cases**: Configuration changes, fee adjustments

#### Upgrade Proposals

- **Voting Period**: 7 days
- **Timelock**: 14 days
- **Quorum**: 33.3% of total voting power
- **Authorization**: Enhanced proposal threshold
- **Use Cases**: Smart contract upgrades, major protocol changes

### Voting Power Calculation

The voting power system uses a multi-factor approach to ensure fair representation:

```cairo
voting_power = base_power + stake_bonus + reputation_bonus + lock_bonus + resource_bonus
```

#### Components

1. **Base Power**: `sqrt(token_balance)` (quadratic voting)
2. **Stake Bonus**: `(stake_amount * 50) / 100` (50% bonus for staking)
3. **Reputation Bonus**: `(reputation_score * base_power) / REPUTATION_SCALE`
4. **Lock Bonus**: Time-weighted bonus for longer token locks
   - 1 year lock: 50% bonus
   - 6 months lock: 25% bonus
   - Less than 6 months: No bonus
5. **Resource Bonus**: Bonus based on contributed computational resources

### Delegation System

- **Flexible Delegation**: Users can delegate voting power to any address
- **Automatic Tracking**: Delegated power is automatically tracked and updated
- **Revocable**: Delegations can be changed or revoked at any time
- **Event Logging**: All delegation changes are logged for transparency

## Upgradability Patterns

### UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard)

**Advantages:**

- Gas efficient (no storage reads in proxy)
- Implementation controls upgrades
- Smaller proxy contract size

**Implementation:**

```cairo
#[starknet::contract]
mod UUPSProxy {
    use ciro_contracts::utils::upgradability::UUPSProxyComponent;
    
    component!(path: UUPSProxyComponent, storage: uups, event: UUPSEvent);
    
    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl UUPSProxyImpl = UUPSProxyComponent::UUPSProxyImpl<ContractState>;
    
    impl UUPSInternalImpl = UUPSProxyComponent::InternalImpl<ContractState>;
}
```

### Transparent Proxy

**Advantages:**

- Clear separation between admin and user functions
- Prevents function selector clashes
- Well-established pattern

**Implementation:**

```cairo
#[starknet::contract]
mod TransparentProxy {
    use ciro_contracts::utils::upgradability::TransparentProxyComponent;
    
    component!(path: TransparentProxyComponent, storage: transparent, event: TransparentEvent);
    
    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl TransparentProxyImpl = TransparentProxyComponent::TransparentProxyImpl<ContractState>;
    
    impl TransparentInternalImpl = TransparentProxyComponent::InternalImpl<ContractState>;
}
```

### Diamond Proxy (Multi-Facet)

**Advantages:**

- Modular upgrades (upgrade individual functions)
- Overcome contract size limits
- Flexible architecture

**Implementation:**

```cairo
#[starknet::contract]
mod DiamondProxy {
    use ciro_contracts::utils::upgradability::DiamondProxyComponent;
    
    component!(path: DiamondProxyComponent, storage: diamond, event: DiamondEvent);
    
    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl DiamondProxyImpl = DiamondProxyComponent::DiamondProxyImpl<ContractState>;
    
    impl DiamondInternalImpl = DiamondProxyComponent::InternalImpl<ContractState>;
}
```

### Job-Aware Upgrades

The job-aware upgrade system ensures that computational jobs are not interrupted during upgrades:

#### Key Features

1. **Active Job Tracking**: Monitors running computational jobs
2. **Graceful Scheduling**: Schedules upgrades when no jobs are active
3. **Maximum Delay**: Enforces upgrade execution after maximum delay
4. **Maintenance Mode**: Prevents new jobs during upgrade preparation
5. **Emergency Override**: Allows forced upgrades in critical situations

#### Upgrade Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Request Upgrade] --> B{Active Jobs?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Schedule After Jobs Complete]
    B -->|No| D[Schedule After Grace Period]
    C --> E{Max Delay Exceeded?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Force Upgrade]
    E -->|No| G[Wait for Jobs]
    G --> H{Jobs Complete?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Execute Upgrade]
    H -->|No| E
    D --> I
    F --> I
    I --> J[Upgrade Complete]
```

## Security Considerations

### Multi-Layer Security

1. **Authorization Layer**
   - Role-based access control
   - Multi-signature requirements
   - Emergency council powers

2. **Validation Layer**
   - Proposal parameter validation
   - Upgrade compatibility checks
   - State migration validation

3. **Execution Layer**
   - Timelock enforcement
   - Atomic upgrade execution
   - Rollback capabilities

4. **Monitoring Layer**
   - Event logging
   - State change tracking
   - Anomaly detection

### Emergency Procedures

#### Emergency Pause

- Immediate halt of all non-critical functions
- Triggered by emergency council or critical vulnerabilities
- Requires governance vote to resume

#### Emergency Upgrade

- Bypass normal timelock for critical security fixes
- Requires multi-signature approval
- Limited to security-related changes

#### Rollback Mechanisms

- Automatic rollback on upgrade failure
- Manual rollback for discovered issues
- State restoration from pre-upgrade snapshots

## Implementation Guide

### Setting Up Governance

1. **Deploy Governance Contract**

```cairo
#[starknet::contract]
mod CIROGovernance {
    use ciro_contracts::utils::governance::GovernanceComponent;
    
    component!(path: GovernanceComponent, storage: governance, event: GovernanceEvent);
    
    #[abi(embed_v0)]
    impl GovernanceImpl = GovernanceComponent::GovernanceImpl<ContractState>;
    
    impl GovernanceInternalImpl = GovernanceComponent::InternalImpl<ContractState>;
    
    #[constructor]
    fn constructor(
        ref self: ContractState,
        governance_token: ContractAddress,
        emergency_multisig: ContractAddress,
        initial_config: GovernanceConfig
    ) {
        self.governance.initializer(initial_config);
    }
}
```

2. **Configure Initial Parameters**

```cairo
let config = GovernanceConfig {
    voting_period: 604800, // 7 days
    timelock_delay: 604800, // 7 days
    proposal_threshold: 1000000, // 1M tokens
    quorum_threshold: 5000000, // 5M tokens
    emergency_multisig: emergency_multisig_address,
    governance_token: token_address,
    max_operations_per_proposal: 10,
};
```

### Setting Up Upgradability

1. **Choose Upgrade Pattern**
   - UUPS for gas efficiency
   - Transparent for simplicity
   - Diamond for modularity

2. **Deploy Proxy Contract**

```cairo
let proxy = deploy_contract(
    "UUPSProxy",
    array![implementation_hash, admin_address]
);
```

3. **Configure Job-Aware Upgrades**

```cairo
let job_aware_upgrade = deploy_contract(
    "JobAwareUpgrade",
    array![
        admin_address,
        job_registry_address,
        3600, // 1 hour grace period
        604800 // 7 days max delay
    ]

# 🌌 Welcome to Ciro Network: The Future of Verifiable AI

**We’re so glad you’re here.** Whether you’re a developer, GPU provider, researcher, or just curious about the future of decentralized intelligence, you belong in the Ciro community. This is a place for everyone who believes that AI should be open, trustworthy, and accessible to all.

## ✨ A Vision Born from the Real World

Ciro wasn’t born in a hackathon or a whitepaper. It was born on the factory floor—where milliseconds and margins matter, and where the cost of compute can make or break innovation. When our team faced $60,000/month AWS surges running computer vision for Latin American factories, we had a choice: accept the status quo, or build something better.

We chose to build. First for ourselves. Now, for the world.

## 🕸️ A Living, Global Supercomputer

Ciro is not a company. It’s a living network—a digital commons—where anyone can:
- **Contribute**: Share your GPU and earn, no matter where you are.
- **Build**: Launch AI apps, models, and experiments without permission.
- **Verify**: Trust every result, because every computation is cryptographically proven.
- **Govern**: Help steer the network’s future, as a true community owner.

We are weaving together the world’s idle compute into a single, unstoppable force for progress.

## 🛡️ Verifiable AI for a Trustless World

Today’s AI is a black box. Ciro brings **ZK-ML (Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning)** to the world:
- Every inference, every result, every proof is mathematically verifiable.
- No more “just believe us”—now you can check for yourself.
- This is AI you can trust with your business, your research, your life.

## 🌍 Power to the People

Ciro is for everyone:
- **GPU Providers**: Turn your hardware into a source of income and impact.
- **Developers**: Build the next generation of AI—open, censorship-resistant, and community-owned.
- **Users**: Access cutting-edge models without being locked into walled gardens.
- **Dreamers & Doers**: Shape the network, propose ideas, and vote on its direction.

We believe the future of AI should be written by the many, not the few.

## 📊 The Reality Check

| Provider           | Cost per H100-hour   | Availability         | Verification      | Sovereignty         |
|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **AWS/Azure**      | $4.10-6.98          | Geographic limits    | Trust-based       | Corporate controlled|
| **Render**         | ~$2.50 (OBH)        | 3D rendering focus   | Watermarking      | Partial governance  |
| **Akash**          | ~$1.15              | General compute      | Reputation        | Cosmos governance   |
| **io.net/Spheron** | $1.87-2.40          | ML optimization      | Proof-of-work     | Token governance    |
| **Ciro Network**   | $1.40-2.20          | Global mesh          | **ZK-proven**     | Community owned     |

*Ciro's strategic advantage: While competitors compete on price or specialization, Ciro enables **provably correct computation**—unlocking new markets like DeFi AI and on-chain gaming that require cryptographic guarantees.*

### **Performance Metrics That Matter**
- **15,000 transactions per second** achieved in optimized testnet conditions (Mainnet: ~127 TPS sustained)
- **Sub-200ms latency** demonstrated in distributed test environments

## 🛠️ Built for Reality

Ciro isn’t theory—it’s running in the wild:
- **Industrial Vision**: Object detection on assembly lines
- **Medical AI**: HIPAA-compliant diagnostic imaging
- **Financial Models**: Risk analysis for emerging markets
- **Research Computing**: Training smaller models on federated data

Each use case taught us what actually matters: **reliability**, **verifiability**, and **economic sustainability**.

---

## 🎯 The Ciro Difference

- **🧠 ZK-ML Verification**: Every AI computation generates a STARK proof of correctness, verified on Starknet in ~2 seconds.
- **⚡ Hybrid Orchestration**: Smart routing between on-premises, edge, and network resources based on latency, cost, and security requirements.
- **💎 Economic Design**: Token-curated registry of compute providers with slashing for malicious behavior and rewards for performance.

# ü§ó Welcome, Compute Users!

**We‚Äôre so glad you‚Äôre here.** Whether you‚Äôre an AI developer, a data scientist, a DeFi builder, or just curious about running powerful jobs on decentralized infrastructure, you belong in the Ciro community.

## üå± Our Story: Built for Real-World Needs

Ciro Network was born out of necessity‚Äîon the factory floor, not in a hackathon. We saw how hard it was to access affordable, reliable compute for real-world AI and data jobs. So we built Ciro: a decentralized network where anyone can access high-performance compute, pay as they go, and trust the results.

## ü§î What Does It Mean to Be a User?

As a Ciro user, you:
- **Run AI, data, or compute jobs** on a global network of GPUs
- **Pay only for what you use**‚Äîno subscriptions, no lock-in
- **Choose your payment chain**: Starknet, Ethereum, Polygon, and more
- **Get verifiable results** with cryptographic proofs (ZK-ML)
- **Join a movement** for open, accessible, and trustworthy compute

No blockchain or AI expertise required‚Äîjust a need for compute and a willingness to try something new!

## üåê Multichain Access & Payment

Ciro is built for the multichain future. You can:
- **Pay for jobs** with CIRO, USDC, or other tokens on Starknet, Ethereum, Polygon
- **Bridge your funds** to the chain that fits your needs
- **Access compute globally**‚Äîno matter where you are

| Chain      | Payment Options | Best For                  |
|------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| Starknet   | CIRO, USDC     | Fastest, lowest fees      |
| Ethereum   | CIRO, USDC     | High-value, enterprise    |
| Polygon    | CIRO, USDC     | Retail, low-cost, gaming  |

## üöÄ Step-by-Step: Run Your First Compute Job

### 1. Sign Up & Get Tokens
- Visit [faucet.testnet.ciro.network](https://faucet.testnet.ciro.network) for testnet tokens
- Connect your wallet (Starknet, MetaMask, or WalletConnect)

### 2. Choose Your Payment Chain
- Decide where you want to pay/settle (Starknet, Ethereum, Polygon)
- Bridge funds if needed (see [docs.ciro.network/payments](https://docs.ciro.network/payments))

### 3. Submit Your Job
- Use the Ciro web app, CLI, or SDK:
```bash
# Example: Submit an AI inference job
ciro-cli submit-job --model image_recognition_v1 --input ./my-image.jpg --pay-with starknet
```
Or use the web UI to upload your data and select your model.

### 4. Track Your Results
- Monitor job status in real time:
```bash
ciro-cli job-status --job-id 1234
```
- Get notified when your job is complete
- Download results and cryptographic proofs

### 5. Pay & Settle
- Pay only for completed jobs
- Settle on your preferred chain
- Bridge results or funds as needed

# CIRO Network Licensing

## Overview

CIRO Network implements a **strategic dual licensing approach** designed to protect our intellectual property during the critical MVP phase while maintaining our long-term commitment to open source development.

## License Structure

### Core Smart Contracts - Business Source License 1.1

**Components covered:**
- `cairo-contracts/src/ciro_token.cairo`
- `cairo-contracts/src/cdc_pool.cairo` 
- `cairo-contracts/src/job_manager.cairo`
- `cairo-contracts/src/vesting/`
- `cairo-contracts/src/utils/`
- `src/tokenomics_engine.py`
- Core test files

**License terms:**
- **Current**: Business Source License 1.1
- **Change Date**: January 1, 2029
- **Future License**: Apache License 2.0
- **Additional Use Grant**: Non-commercial use, development, testing, and personal use are permitted

**Restrictions:**
- No competing blockchain networks
- No commercial GPU marketplace services
- No derivative tokenomics for competing protocols

### Developer Tools & SDKs - Apache 2.0

**Components covered:**
- Client libraries and SDKs
- API documentation and examples
- Developer tools and utilities
- Integration helpers

**Benefits:**
- Immediate open source availability
- Patent protection for contributors
- Enterprise-friendly licensing
- Maximum ecosystem adoption

### Documentation & Examples - MIT

**Components covered:**
- Documentation files
- Example applications
- Tutorial code
- Reference implementations

**Benefits:**
- Maximum reusability
- Educational use encouraged
- Minimal legal friction

## Why This Strategy?

### Business Rationale

1. **Competitive Protection**: BSL 1.1 prevents direct competitors from launching clone networks during our critical growth phase

2. **IP Moat**: Protects proprietary tokenomics algorithms and consensus mechanisms that provide competitive advantage

3. **Future Commitment**: Automatic conversion to Apache 2.0 guarantees eventual full open source release

4. **Ecosystem Growth**: Developer tools remain immediately open source to encourage ecosystem development

### Technical Benefits

1. **Quality Control**: Centralized development during MVP phase ensures security and stability

2. **Patent Protection**: Apache 2.0 components include patent grants to protect the ecosystem

3. **Commercial Viability**: BSL allows commercial use except for direct competition

4. **Transparency**: All source code remains publicly viewable for auditing and verification

## Timeline & Transition

### Phase 1: MVP Development (2025-2026)
- Core contracts under BSL 1.1
- Active ecosystem building with Apache 2.0 tools
- Community feedback and iteration

### Phase 2: Market Maturation (2027-2028)
- Continued BSL protection for core IP
- Expanding Apache 2.0 ecosystem components
- Preparation for full open source transition

### Phase 3: Full Open Source (2029+)
- Automatic conversion to Apache 2.0
- Complete decentralization
- Community governance implementation

## Compliance & Contribution

### Contributor License Agreement

All contributors must sign our [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](../CONTRIBUTOR_LICENSE_AGREEMENT.md) which:

- Grants us rights to license contributions under BSL 1.1
- Ensures future Apache 2.0 compatibility
- Provides patent protection for the project
- Maintains contributor attribution

### Commercial Use Guidelines

**Permitted under BSL 1.1:**
- Building applications on CIRO Network
- Using CIRO tokens for legitimate purposes
- Integrating with CIRO APIs and services
- Academic research and education
- Internal enterprise use

**Prohibited under BSL 1.1:**
- Creating competing blockchain networks
- Launching rival GPU marketplaces
- Copying tokenomics for competing protocols
- Commercial redistribution of core contracts

### Audit & Security

Our dual licensing approach enhances security through:

- **Public Code Review**: All code remains visible for security auditing
- **Professional Audits**: Regular third-party security assessments
- **Bug Bounty Programs**: Community-driven vulnerability discovery
- **Transparent Development**: Open development process with public repositories

## Legal Considerations

### Jurisdiction

This licensing strategy is designed to be enforceable under:
- United States copyright law
- European Union copyright directives
- International copyright treaties
- Relevant blockchain regulatory frameworks

### Dispute Resolution

Licensing disputes will be resolved through:
1. Good faith negotiation
2. Mediation through established IP dispute mechanisms
3. Arbitration under international commercial rules
4. Court proceedings as a last resort

### Updates & Modifications

This licensing strategy may be updated to:
- Clarify permitted use cases
- Adjust timelines based on market conditions
- Incorporate regulatory changes
- Enhance ecosystem development

All changes will be announced publicly with adequate notice.

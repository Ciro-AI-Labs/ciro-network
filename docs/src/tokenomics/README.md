# 🪙 CIRO Tokenomics: Powering the Future of Decentralized Compute

> **From Factory Floor to Global Network: The Story of CIRO**
>
> Ciro Network was born not in a hackathon, but on a real factory floor—where the need for fair, transparent, and efficient compute was more than just a theory. The CIRO token is the heartbeat of this mission, aligning incentives for everyone: providers, users, developers, and the community.

## 🌟 What is the CIRO Token?

The **CIRO token** is the native digital asset of the Ciro Network. It is designed to:
- **Incentivize compute providers** to contribute GPU power
- **Reward users** for honest participation and job completion
- **Enable decentralized governance**—every token holder has a voice
- **Secure the network** through staking and slashing
- **Fuel a multichain, cross-domain compute economy**

## 🔢 Token Supply, Inflation & Burn

| **Parameter**         | **Value**                                      |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Initial Supply**   | 1,000,000,000 CIRO                             |
| **Inflation**        | Dynamic, based on network growth and demand    |
| **Burn Mechanism**   | A portion of fees is burned to offset inflation|
| **Upgradeable?**     | Yes, via on-chain governance                   |
| **Multichain?**      | Yes (Starknet core, with Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base settlement) |

- **Why inflation?** To reward early contributors and bootstrap the network
- **Why burn?** To ensure long-term scarcity and value alignment

## 💸 Staking, Providing & Earning

Anyone can participate in the Ciro Network economy:
- **GPU Providers:** Stake CIRO to register, earn rewards for jobs, and boost reputation
- **Users:** Pay for compute jobs in CIRO, benefit from lower fees as the network grows
- **Stakers:** Delegate tokens to providers and share in network rewards

**Rewards are distributed based on:**
- Amount staked
- Performance (job success rate, uptime)
- Network utilization

## 🗳️ Governance: Shape the Future

CIRO token holders are the ultimate decision-makers:
- Propose and vote on protocol upgrades
- Adjust economic parameters (fees, inflation, rewards)
- Elect council members and approve major initiatives

Governance is **on-chain, transparent, and open to all**. Your voice matters!

## 🌉 Multichain & Upgradeability

- **Starknet** is the home of the CIRO token and core contracts
- **Bridges** to Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Base enable cross-chain staking and settlement
- **Upgradeable contracts** allow the protocol to evolve with community consensus

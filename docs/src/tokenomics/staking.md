# üí∏ Staking, Providing & Earning: Powering the Ciro Network

> **From Your GPU to the World: Everyone Can Earn**
>
> Ciro Network is built for everyone‚Äîfrom solo GPU owners to institutional providers. Staking is your ticket to participate, earn, and help secure the future of decentralized compute.

## üå± What is Staking?

**Staking** means locking up CIRO tokens to:
- Prove your commitment to the network
- Gain the right to provide compute jobs
- Earn rewards for honest work
- Help secure the protocol (bad actors are slashed)

Staking aligns everyone‚Äôs incentives‚Äîwhen the network wins, you win.

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Become a Provider

1. **Register your worker:** Submit hardware proof, location, and capabilities
2. **Stake CIRO tokens:** Meet the minimum for your desired tier (see below)
3. **Start earning:** Get matched to jobs, build your reputation, and grow your rewards

- Tiers are based on the USD value of CIRO at the time of staking.

## üéÅ How Rewards Work

- **Base reward:** Every completed job pays a base CIRO amount
- **Performance multiplier:** Higher reputation = bigger rewards
- **Network utilization:** More jobs, more rewards for everyone
- **Pending rewards:** Claimable after job completion and verification

**Example:**
> Alice stakes at the Premium tier, completes 10 jobs with high reputation, and earns more than Bob at Basic tier with lower reputation.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Slashing: Security for All

- **Why?** To keep the network honest and safe
- **Reasons:**
  - Malicious behavior (50%+ slashed)
  - Unavailability (10%)
  - Poor performance (20%)
  - Protocol violation (30%)
  - Fraud (100%)
- **How?** Slashed tokens are burned or sent to the treasury

---

## üîÑ Unstaking: How to Exit

- **Request unstake:** Submit a request (cooldown applies)
- **Cooldown period:** Varies by tier and recent activity
- **Tokens returned:** After cooldown, tokens are unlocked and returned
- **Why cooldown?** Prevents abuse and ensures network stability

## ü§ù Delegators: Earn Without Running Hardware

- **Don‚Äôt have a GPU?** You can still earn by delegating CIRO to trusted providers
- **Share in rewards:** Delegators receive a portion of provider earnings
- **Support the network:** More staked CIRO = stronger, more secure protocol

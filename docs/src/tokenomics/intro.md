# 🪙 The CIRO Token: The Heartbeat of Decentralized Compute

> **Born from Real-World Need, Built for Global Impact**
>
> The CIRO token isn’t just another digital asset—it’s the economic engine that powers the Ciro Network. Conceived on a factory floor, CIRO was designed to solve real problems: fair rewards, transparent governance, and unstoppable security for a new era of decentralized compute.

## 🌟 What is the CIRO Token?

The **CIRO token** is the native, governance-enabled, and utility-rich digital asset of the Ciro Network. It is:
- **The fuel for compute jobs**—pay for and earn rewards in CIRO
- **A governance key**—propose, vote, and shape the protocol’s future
- **A security anchor**—stake to secure the network, with slashing for bad actors
- **A community badge**—the more you participate, the more your voice grows

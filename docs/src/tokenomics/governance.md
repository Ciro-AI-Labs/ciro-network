# 🗳️ Governance: Shape the Future of Ciro Network

> **From Factory Floor to DAO: Real-World Governance for Real Impact**
>
> Ciro Network’s governance isn’t just code—it’s a living, breathing community process. Inspired by real-world collaboration, our on-chain governance ensures every voice matters, every decision is transparent, and the protocol evolves with its people.

## 🌍 What is On-Chain Governance?

On-chain governance means **all major decisions are made by the community, on the blockchain, in the open**. No backroom deals, no hidden changes—just transparent, auditable, and fair protocol evolution.

---

## 📝 How Proposals Work

Anyone with enough CIRO can propose changes, including:
- **Protocol upgrades:** Add new features, fix bugs, or improve security
- **Treasury actions:** Fund grants, partnerships, or ecosystem growth
- **Parameter changes:** Adjust fees, inflation, rewards, or slashing rates
- **Emergency actions:** Pause the protocol, defend against attacks, or recover funds

**Proposal lifecycle:**
1. **Create:** Submit a proposal (must meet minimum token threshold)
2. **Discuss:** Community reviews and debates the proposal
3. **Vote:** Token holders vote (weighted by voting power)
4. **Execute:** If quorum and thresholds are met, the proposal is executed on-chain

## 🏛️ Voting Power & Participation

- **Progressive voting:** The longer you hold CIRO, the more your vote counts (veteran/long-term multipliers)
- **Quorum:** Proposals need enough participation to pass (prevents small groups from making big changes)
- **Supermajority:** Critical changes (upgrades, treasury) require 67%+ support
- **Anti-spam:** Cooldowns and proposal limits per user

---

## 👥 Council & Multi-Sig: Safety Nets for the Network

- **Council:** Elected or appointed members with multi-sig authority for emergencies, upgrades, and treasury actions
- **Multi-sig:** No single person can act alone—major actions require multiple approvals
- **Emergency controls:** Council can pause the protocol, authorize emergency withdrawals, or defend against attacks

---

## 💰 Treasury Management

- **On-chain treasury:** All funds are managed by the DAO, with full transparency
- **Proposals:** Anyone can propose treasury actions (grants, investments, buybacks)
- **Emergency withdrawal:** Council can act quickly if the protocol is threatened
- **Audit tracking:** All treasury actions are logged and reviewed

---

## 🛡️ Security & Safeguards

- **Timelocks:** Delays before execution give the community time to react
- **Audit tracking:** Security reviews and findings are public
- **Blacklisting:** Malicious actors can be excluded by governance
- **Upgradeability:** All changes require on-chain approval and/or council sign-off

---

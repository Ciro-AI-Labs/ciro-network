# Welcome to Ciro

![Ciro Network Banner](./images/ciro-banner.svg)

**TL;DR**: Ciro Network is a decentralized compute layer for real-time AI and ZK workloads, built on Starknet and proven in industrial production environments. Think AWS compute meets DeFi economics, but with mathematical proofs and global reach.

---

## üß¨ **What We're Building**

**In one sentence**: A verifiable compute protocol that transforms underutilized GPUs into a global, trustless supercomputer for AI workloads.

**In one paragraph**: Ciro Network orchestrates distributed GPU resources through cryptographic proofs, enabling enterprises to access verifiable compute that traditional cloud providers simply cannot offer. Built on Starknet with ZK-ML verification, every inference, training job, and proof generation is both economically efficient and cryptographically sound.

**In one page**: The future of AI compute is not centralized data centers‚Äîit's an intelligent mesh of distributed resources, coordinated by economic incentives and secured by zero-knowledge proofs. Ciro Network is that future, operational today. Born from real industrial necessity and battle-tested in production environments, Ciro is designed for engineers, researchers, and organizations who demand verifiable, censorship-resistant, and cost-efficient compute for real-world AI and ZK workloads.

## üî• **Born From Necessity**

![Industrial AI Origin](./images/D-INTREf5jrlgqePdbN9Q.png)

Ciro wasn't born in a hackathon‚Äîit was born on the factory floor.

When our computer vision systems for Latin American industrial plants hit **$60,000/month AWS surges**, we faced a choice: accept the economic brutality of centralized compute, or build something smarter. Our industrial vision systems were processing thousands of defect detection jobs daily, but centralized clouds were draining resources faster than we could scale.

We chose to build.

First for ourselves. Then for the world.

The result? A protocol achieving **15,000 transactions per second** on Starknet testnet, with **sub-200ms latency** and production-ready architecture. Currently in final testing phase before mainnet deployment to real factories, production lines, and enterprise environments.

## ‚ö° **Why This Matters**

### **üî¨ Scientific Sovereignty**
AI shouldn't require permission from hyperscale clouds. Researchers, startups, and enterprises deserve compute sovereignty‚Äîthe ability to run AI workloads without vendor lock-in, geographic restrictions, or opaque pricing. When compute infrastructure becomes a bottleneck to innovation, progress stagnates.

### **üåç Economic Liberation** 
The current compute oligopoly wastes resources while inflating costs. Centralized providers charge premium rates while millions of GPUs sit idle globally. Ciro creates a more efficient market that redistributes value to GPU owners worldwide, enabling competitive pricing through genuine market dynamics rather than corporate markup.

### **üõ°Ô∏è Verifiable Truth**
In an era of AI hallucinations and deepfakes, Ciro provides mathematical proof that your AI computations are correct. Every inference carries a ZK-proof of validity‚Äîno trust required. When your model says a medical scan is clear or a financial transaction is valid, you need more than "trust us."

### **üöÄ Unstoppable Innovation**
Decentralized compute accelerates AI development by removing barriers to experimentation. When compute is abundant and affordable, innovation flourishes. When it's scarce and expensive, only the biggest players can participate.

## üìä **The Reality Check**

| Provider | Cost per H100-hour | Availability | Verification | Sovereignty |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| **AWS/Azure** | $4.10-6.98 | Geographic limits | Trust-based | Corporate controlled |
| **Render** | ~$2.50 (OBH) | 3D rendering focus | Watermarking | Partial governance |
| **Akash** | ~$1.15 | General compute | Reputation | Cosmos governance |
| **io.net/Spheron** | $1.87-2.40 | ML optimization | Proof-of-work | Token governance |
| **Ciro Network** | $1.40-2.20 | Global mesh | **ZK-proven** | Community owned |

*Ciro's strategic advantage: While competitors compete on price or specialization, Ciro enables **provably correct computation**‚Äîunlocking new markets like DeFi AI and on-chain gaming that require cryptographic guarantees.*

### **Performance Metrics That Matter**
- **15,000 transactions per second** achieved in optimized testnet conditions (Mainnet: ~127 TPS sustained)
- **Sub-200ms latency** demonstrated in distributed test environments
- **Production-ready architecture** validated through comprehensive testing
- **Competitive pricing** targeting $1.40-2.20/H100-hour vs. AWS $4.10+ and Azure $6.98+

## üéØ **Technical Elegance**

![Technical Innovation](./images/5q1CEpAiyuKgeZ-XtXdY5.png)

Ciro achieves this through three core innovations:

### **üß† ZK-ML Verification**
Every AI computation generates a STARK proof of correctness, verified on Starknet in ~2 seconds. Not just attestations or hash commitments‚Äîmathematical proof that your inference was computed correctly on the specified model with the given inputs.

### **‚ö° Hybrid Orchestration** 
Smart routing between on-premises, edge, and network resources based on latency, cost, and security requirements. Your workload automatically finds the optimal compute environment without manual configuration.

### **üíé Economic Design**
Token-curated registry of compute providers with slashing conditions for malicious behavior and rewards for performance. Economics aligned for reliability, not just lowest price.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Built for Reality**

![Real World Applications](./images/r-tL5EJBu1BDmkpj7VVU1.png)

Unlike theoretical compute protocols, Ciro emerged from real-world usage:

### **üè≠ Industrial Vision**
Object detection on assembly lines processing **thousands of items per hour**. When a false negative costs $10K in defective products, verification isn't academic‚Äîit's economic survival.

### **üè• Medical AI**
HIPAA-compliant diagnostic imaging where patient safety demands both privacy and accuracy. Decentralized compute with cryptographic guarantees meets regulatory requirements that centralized clouds struggle with.

### **üí∞ Financial Models**
Risk analysis for emerging markets where data sovereignty and computational auditability aren't optional features‚Äîthey're legal requirements.

### **üî¨ Research Computing**
Training smaller models on federated data where compute costs can't exceed research grants, but results need to be reproducible and verifiable.

Each use case taught us what actually matters: **reliability**, **verifiability**, and **economic sustainability**. Not just theoretical scalability or benchmark performance.

---

## üåê **The Network Effect**

Ciro's power grows with its network:

### **Provider Diversity**
From gaming rigs in bedrooms to enterprise data centers, every GPU can contribute. Geographic and economic diversity creates resilience that no single cloud provider can match.

### **Workload Intelligence**
The network learns optimal placement for different workload types. Computer vision jobs route to providers with appropriate memory bandwidth. Training jobs find the lowest-latency multi-GPU clusters.

### **Economic Efficiency**
Market forces drive prices down while reliability requirements drive quality up. Providers compete on performance metrics, not marketing budgets.

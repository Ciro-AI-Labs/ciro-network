# Enterprise Overview

**Ciro Network transforms industrial AI infrastructure, reducing compute costs by 70% while providing cryptographic verification and regulatory compliance.** Built by engineers who deploy AI in real manufacturing plants, we solve the fundamental challenges that prevent enterprises from scaling AI operations.

## üè≠ **Built for Industrial Reality**

### **Our Enterprise Heritage**

**Ciro AI Labs** has deployed computer vision systems in:
- **Manufacturing plants**: 24/7 safety monitoring and quality control
- **Oil & gas facilities**: Pipeline monitoring and leak detection  
- **Mining operations**: Equipment safety and operational efficiency
- **Power plants**: Predictive maintenance and compliance monitoring

This real-world experience revealed the **infrastructure problems** that enterprise AI faces today.

### **The Enterprise AI Challenge**

**Traditional Approach:**
```
Cloud-Only Strategy Problems:
‚Ä¢ Unpredictable costs: $15K ‚Üí $60K surge bills
‚Ä¢ Regulatory constraints: Sensitive data cannot leave premises  
‚Ä¢ Performance issues: High latency, network dependencies
‚Ä¢ Vendor lock-in: Limited negotiation power with Big Tech
‚Ä¢ Security gaps: No verification of computation correctness
‚Ä¢ Compliance burden: Manual audit trails and reporting
```

**Ciro Network Solution:**
```
Hybrid Infrastructure Approach:
‚Ä¢ Predictable costs: 70-80% reduction in total compute spend
‚Ä¢ Regulatory compliance: On-premises + ZK verification + cloud fallback
‚Ä¢ Enterprise performance: <100ms latency, 99.99% uptime SLAs
‚Ä¢ Vendor neutrality: Multiple providers, open standards
‚Ä¢ Cryptographic security: ZK-ML proofs for verifiable AI
‚Ä¢ Automated compliance: Built-in audit trails and reporting
```

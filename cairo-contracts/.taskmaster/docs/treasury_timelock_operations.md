   ```bash
   # Step 1: Prepare transaction data
   TARGET=<recipient_address>
   VALUE=<amount_in_wei>
   DESCRIPTION="Treasury transfer: <purpose>"
   
   # Step 2: Submit proposal via multisig member
   starkli invoke <timelock_address> propose_transaction \
     --account <multisig_member_account> \

     <new_parameter_values>
   ```

5. **Extended Review Period**

     <new_member_address>
   ```

**Member Removal Process**:
1. **Removal Justification**
   - Document reason for removal
   - Ensure proper notification

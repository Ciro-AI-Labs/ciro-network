**Critical Functions to Check**:
```cairo
// Job Manager
- submit_job() -> external token transfer

// CDC Pool
- stake() -> token transfer
- unstake() -> token transfer
- claim_rewards() -> reward distribution
```

#### 3.2 Integer Overflow/Underflow

- [ ] **Invariant Preservation**: Critical invariants always maintained

### 4. Upgrade & Governance Security

#### 4.1 Upgrade Mechanisms
- [ ] **Upgrade Authorization**: Only authorized accounts can upgrade
- [ ] **Upgrade Delays**: Proper time delays for security

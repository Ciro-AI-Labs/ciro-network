# CIRO Token v3.1 - Enhanced Security Implementation

## Overview

The CIRO Token is the core utility token for the CIRO Network, a decentralized
AI computation platform. This implementation includes comprehensive security
features, progressive governance, worker tier economics, and anti-manipulation
mechanisms.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

1. **ERC20 Token**: Standard token functionality with 18 decimals
2. **Worker Tier System**: 8-tier staking system with realistic capital
   deployment thresholds
3. **Progressive Governance**: Time-weighted voting with security measures
4. **Tokenomics Engine**: Automated burn/mint mechanics based on network revenue
5. **Security Framework**: Comprehensive security monitoring and emergency
   systems

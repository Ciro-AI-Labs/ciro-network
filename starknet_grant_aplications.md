What is Ciro Network?
Ciro Network is a next-generation decentralized compute marketplace and protocol, designed to connect global demand for high-performance computing (HPC) with a distributed supply of GPU and compute resources. By leveraging blockchain technology (Starknet, Cairo smart contracts) and advanced tokenomics, Ciro Network enables anyone to buy, sell, and utilize compute power in a secure, transparent, and efficient way.

Key Features
Decentralized Compute Marketplace:
Users can request compute jobs (AI/ML, rendering, scientific simulations, etc.) and providers can offer their idle GPU/CPU resources, all coordinated by smart contracts.

Starknet-Powered Security:
All transactions, job assignments, and payments are managed by audited Cairo smart contracts on Starknet, ensuring trustless execution and transparency.

CIRO Token Economy:
The native CIRO token powers the network, enabling payments, staking, governance, and incentivizing both compute providers and consumers.

Advanced Tokenomics:
Features include dynamic supply, adaptive inflation, revenue-based burn mechanics, and robust governance, all designed for long-term sustainability and value accrual.



Open Participation:
Anyone can join as a compute provider, consumer, or network participant, lowering barriers to entry for both individuals and organizations.

Governance & Security:
Decentralized governance with emergency multisig, transparent proposal thresholds, and community-driven upgrades.

Why Are We Building This?
Global Demand for Compute:
The world’s need for AI/ML, scientific, and rendering compute is exploding, but access is limited by centralized providers, high costs, and opaque allocation.

Unlocking Idle Resources:
Billions of dollars in GPU/CPU resources sit idle in data centers, research labs, and even personal devices. Ciro Network unlocks this latent capacity for global use.



Democratizing Access:
By decentralizing the compute market, we enable fair pricing, open access, and censorship resistance for all users.

Sustainable, Research-Driven Economics:
Our tokenomics are designed for real-world sustainability, with mechanisms to prevent runaway inflation, reward long-term participants, and ensure the network’s security budget is always met.

Community Ownership:
Ciro Network is built for and by its community, with open governance and transparent development.



Vision
Ciro Network aims to become the backbone of decentralized compute infrastructure, powering the next wave of AI, scientific research, and digital innovation—owned and operated by its users.

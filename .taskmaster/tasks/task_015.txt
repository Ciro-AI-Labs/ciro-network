# Task ID: 15
# Title: Worker Desktop Application UI Design
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design the user interface for the worker desktop application with earnings dashboard, job queue visibility, and system monitoring, ensuring cross-platform support for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
# Details:
1. Create wireframes for desktop application with explicit cross-platform considerations
2. Design the following screens:
   - Worker setup and registration
   - Dashboard with earnings and stats
   - Job queue and history
   - System performance monitoring
   - Settings and configuration
   - Staking/unstaking interface
3. Create style guide and component library that works across all platforms
4. Design responsive layouts
5. Create user flows and interactions that respect platform-specific conventions:
   - Windows Metro design patterns
   - macOS Human Interface Guidelines
   - Linux GTK/Qt patterns
6. Design notifications and alerts with platform-appropriate styling
7. Create dark and light themes
8. Develop platform-specific UI adjustments while maintaining brand consistency
9. Document platform-specific design considerations and implementation notes

Recommended technologies:
- Tauri for cross-platform desktop app
- React or Svelte for UI
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Chart.js or D3.js for visualizations
- Electron as fallback if Tauri has limitations

Cross-platform support is a PRIMARY requirement - all design decisions must account for compatibility across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

# Test Strategy:
1. Conduct user testing with wireframes
2. Review designs with stakeholders
3. Test responsive layouts
4. Validate user flows and interactions
5. Test accessibility compliance
6. Verify design system consistency
7. Test designs on all three target platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
8. Validate platform-specific adaptations meet both platform conventions and brand guidelines
9. Conduct usability testing with users from each platform

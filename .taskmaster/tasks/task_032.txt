# Task ID: 32
# Title: Complete Job Manager Placeholder Implementations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Fix critical broken functionality in the Job Manager by implementing proper replacements for hardcoded placeholders that are currently blocking job assignment and result submission functionality.
# Details:
This task involves replacing hardcoded placeholders in the Job Manager implementation with proper functionality:

1. **Worker ID to Address Conversion (Line 278)**:
   - Remove the hardcoded address `0x1234` and implement proper worker ID to address conversion
   - Integrate with the Worker Registry to fetch the actual worker address based on worker ID
   - Implement error handling for non-existent worker IDs
   - Example implementation:
   ```cairo
   fn get_worker_address(worker_id: felt252) -> ContractAddress {
       // Query the CDC Pool contract for the worker's registered address
       let cdc_pool = ICDCPoolDispatcher { contract_address: self.cdc_pool_address };
       let worker_address = cdc_pool.get_worker_address(worker_id);
       assert(!worker_address.is_zero(), 'Worker ID not registered');
       worker_address
   }
   ```

2. **Result Hash Calculation (Line 381)**:
   - Implement proper cryptographic hashing for job results
   - Use Pedersen hash or Poseidon hash depending on gas efficiency requirements
   - Include all relevant job data in the hash calculation
   - Example implementation:
   ```cairo
   fn calculate_result_hash(job_id: u256, result: Array<felt252>) -> felt252 {
       // Create a buffer with job_id and result data
       let mut hash_input = ArrayTrait::new();
       
       // Add job_id bytes to input
       hash_input.append(job_id.low);
       hash_input.append(job_id.high);
       
       // Add all result elements
       let mut i: u32 = 0;
       loop {
           if i >= result.len() {
               break;
           }
           hash_input.append(*result.at(i));
           i += 1;
       };
       
       // Calculate and return the hash
       poseidon_hash_span(hash_input.span())
   }
   ```

3. **Worker Statistics Implementation (Line 406)**:
   - Replace dummy worker statistics with actual data from storage
   - Implement tracking for completed jobs, success rate, and average completion time
   - Add storage variables to track worker performance metrics
   - Example implementation:
   ```cairo
   #[storage]
   struct WorkerStats {
       completed_jobs: LegacyMap<felt252, u64>,
       successful_jobs: LegacyMap<felt252, u64>,
       total_processing_time: LegacyMap<felt252, u64>,
   }
   
   fn get_worker_stats(worker_id: felt252) -> WorkerStatistics {
       let completed = self.completed_jobs.read(worker_id);
       let successful = self.successful_jobs.read(worker_id);
       let total_time = self.total_processing_time.read(worker_id);
       
       let success_rate = if completed == 0 {
           0
       } else {
           (successful * 100) / completed
       };
       
       let avg_time = if completed == 0 {
           0
       } else {
           total_time / completed
       };
       
       WorkerStatistics {
           completed_jobs: completed,
           success_rate: success_rate,
           avg_completion_time: avg_time,
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Configuration Value Getter (Line 419)**:
   - Complete the implementation of the configuration value getter
   - Add proper storage for configuration parameters
   - Implement default values for missing configuration
   - Example implementation:
   ```cairo
   #[storage]
   struct ConfigStorage {
       config_values: LegacyMap<felt252, felt252>,
       config_initialized: LegacyMap<felt252, bool>,
   }
   
   fn get_config_value(key: felt252, default_value: felt252) -> felt252 {
       if self.config_initialized.read(key) {
           self.config_values.read(key)
       } else {
           default_value
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Integration Testing**:
   - Ensure all implementations work together correctly
   - Update any dependent functions that rely on these implementations
   - Verify that job assignment and result submission flows work end-to-end

# Test Strategy:
1. **Unit Tests for Worker ID to Address Conversion**:
   - Test conversion with valid worker IDs
   - Test error handling with non-existent worker IDs
   - Test integration with CDC Pool contract using mock responses
   - Verify proper error messages are displayed

2. **Unit Tests for Result Hash Calculation**:
   - Test hash calculation with various input sizes
   - Verify deterministic output for identical inputs
   - Test with edge cases (empty results, maximum size inputs)
   - Benchmark gas usage for different result sizes

3. **Unit Tests for Worker Statistics**:
   - Test statistics calculation with various worker histories
   - Verify correct calculation of success rates and averages
   - Test with new workers (zero completed jobs)
   - Test with workers having different performance profiles

4. **Unit Tests for Configuration Value Getter**:
   - Test retrieval of existing configuration values
   - Test default value fallback for uninitialized settings
   - Test with various configuration keys and values
   - Verify thread safety and concurrent access patterns

5. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test complete job lifecycle with the new implementations
   - Verify job assignment works correctly with real worker addresses
   - Test result submission and verification flow
   - Verify proper storage and retrieval of worker statistics

6. **Regression Tests**:
   - Ensure existing functionality continues to work
   - Verify no performance degradation in critical paths
   - Test backward compatibility with existing data

7. **Deployment Verification**:
   - Deploy to testnet and verify all functions work as expected
   - Test with real worker nodes to ensure compatibility

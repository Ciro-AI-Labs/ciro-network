# Task ID: 43
# Title: Advanced Upgrade Orchestration System Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 35, 3, 4, 30
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance the upgradability system with advanced orchestration capabilities including cross-contract coordination, validation mechanisms, rollback functionality, version management, and governance integration.
# Details:
This task involves extending the basic upgrade patterns in `src/utils/upgradability.cairo` to create a comprehensive upgrade orchestration system:

1. **Cross-Contract Upgrade Coordination**:
   - Implement a `UpgradeCoordinator` component that manages dependencies between contracts during upgrades
   - Create a dependency graph representation for contract relationships:
   ```cairo
   #[derive(Drop, Serde)]
   struct ContractDependency {
       contract_address: ContractAddress,
       dependency_type: DependencyType,
       is_critical: bool,
   }

   #[derive(Drop, Serde)]
   struct UpgradePlan {
       target_contracts: Array<ContractAddress>,
       new_implementations: Array<ContractAddress>,
       execution_order: Array<u8>,
       dependencies: Array<ContractDependency>,
       fallback_implementations: Option<Array<ContractAddress>>,
   }
   ```
   - Implement atomic multi-contract upgrade transactions that ensure all-or-nothing execution
   - Add synchronization mechanisms to maintain system consistency during upgrades

2. **Upgrade Validation Mechanisms**:
   - Create pre-upgrade validation hooks that verify new implementation compatibility:
   ```cairo
   trait UpgradeValidator {
       fn validate_upgrade(
           old_implementation: ContractAddress,
           new_implementation: ContractAddress,
           context: UpgradeContext
       ) -> Result<(), UpgradeValidationError>;
   }
   ```
   - Implement storage layout compatibility checks between versions
   - Add interface conformance validation to ensure new implementations maintain required interfaces
   - Create test harness for simulating upgrades in isolated environments before execution
   - Implement post-upgrade verification to confirm system integrity

3. **Rollback Mechanisms**:
   - Create a transaction checkpoint system that can revert to previous states
   - Implement automatic rollback triggers based on health metrics:
   ```cairo
   #[derive(Drop, Serde)]
   struct RollbackTrigger {
       metric_name: felt252,
       threshold: u256,
       comparison: ComparisonType,
       grace_period: u64,
   }
   ```
   - Add manual rollback capabilities with appropriate governance controls
   - Implement state migration rollback for complex upgrades
   - Create comprehensive logging for upgrade attempts and rollbacks

4. **Version Management System**:
   - Implement semantic versioning for contract implementations:
   ```cairo
   #[derive(Drop, Serde)]
   struct ContractVersion {
       major: u8,
       minor: u8,
       patch: u8,
       build_metadata: felt252,
   }
   ```
   - Create a version registry that tracks all deployed versions
   - Add compatibility matrices between different contract versions
   - Implement version history tracking with deployment timestamps
   - Create upgrade path validation based on version constraints

5. **Upgrade Governance Integration**:
   - Integrate with the MultiSigComponent for approval workflows
   - Implement time-locked upgrades with cancellation capabilities
   - Create upgrade proposal system with stakeholder voting:
   ```cairo
   #[derive(Drop, Serde)]
   struct UpgradeProposal {
       id: u64,
       proposer: ContractAddress,
       upgrade_plan: UpgradePlan,
       description: felt252,
       voting_period: u64,
       required_approvals: u8,
       status: ProposalStatus,
   }
   ```
   - Add emergency upgrade capabilities with appropriate safeguards
   - Implement upgrade announcement system for notifying stakeholders

6. **Upgrade Monitoring and Metrics**:
   - Create comprehensive logging for all upgrade-related activities
   - Implement health checks for monitoring system stability post-upgrade
   - Add performance comparison metrics between versions
   - Create dashboards for visualizing upgrade history and impact

7. **Integration with Existing Components**:
   - Integrate with ContractRegistryComponent for tracking upgraded contracts
   - Leverage EventBusComponent for broadcasting upgrade events
   - Utilize CircuitBreakerComponent for emergency stops during problematic upgrades
   - Connect with ReputationComponent to track developer reliability for upgrades

# Test Strategy:
The testing strategy will verify the correctness, safety, and reliability of the advanced upgrade orchestration system:

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Write comprehensive unit tests for each component with 90%+ code coverage
   - Test upgrade coordination with various dependency configurations
   - Test validation mechanisms with compatible and incompatible implementations
   - Test rollback functionality under different failure scenarios
   - Test version management with various version transitions
   - Test governance integration with different approval workflows

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Create test suites that verify interactions between all upgrade components
   - Test cross-contract upgrades with complex dependency graphs
   - Test integration with ContractRegistry, EventBus, and other system components
   - Verify proper event emission during upgrade processes
   - Test governance workflows from proposal to execution

3. **Simulation Testing**:
   - Create a simulation environment that can model complex upgrade scenarios
   - Test multi-contract upgrades with intentionally introduced failures
   - Measure system recovery time after rollbacks
   - Simulate various network conditions during upgrades

4. **Security Testing**:
   - Conduct comprehensive security review of upgrade mechanisms
   - Test permission controls and access restrictions
   - Verify that unauthorized actors cannot trigger upgrades
   - Test emergency procedures and safeguards
   - Perform formal verification of critical upgrade paths

5. **Regression Testing**:
   - Create automated regression tests that verify system functionality after upgrades
   - Test backward compatibility with previous contract versions
   - Verify data integrity across upgrades

6. **Performance Testing**:
   - Measure gas costs for various upgrade scenarios
   - Benchmark upgrade execution time for different contract complexities
   - Test system performance before and after upgrades

7. **Testnet Deployment**:
   - Deploy the upgrade system to Starknet testnet
   - Perform end-to-end upgrade tests in a realistic environment
   - Validate upgrade orchestration with actual contract deployments

8. **Documentation and Verification**:
   - Create comprehensive documentation of upgrade patterns and best practices
   - Develop verification checklists for upgrade readiness
   - Create audit procedures for upgrade proposals

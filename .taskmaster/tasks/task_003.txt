# Task ID: 3
# Title: JobMgr Smart Contract Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the JobMgr contract in Cairo 1.0 with escrow functionality, job submission, and basic result attestation.
# Details:
1. Implement the JobMgr contract with the following functions:
   - `submit_job(model_id: felt252, inputs: Array<felt252>, payment: u256) -> job_id: u256`
   - `register_model(model_hash: felt252, requirements: ModelRequirements) -> model_id: felt252`
   - `submit_result(job_id: u256, result_hash: felt252, worker_signature: Array<felt252>)`
   - `verify_result(job_id: u256, result: Array<felt252>) -> bool`
   - `release_payment(job_id: u256)`
   - `dispute_result(job_id: u256, evidence: Array<felt252>)`

2. Implement data structures:
```cairo
#[derive(Drop, Serde)]
struct Job {
    id: u256,
    model_id: felt252,
    inputs: Array<felt252>,
    status: JobStatus,
    result_hash: felt252,
    worker: ContractAddress,
    payment: u256,
    created_at: u64,
    completed_at: u64,
}

#[derive(Drop, Serde)]
enum JobStatus {
    Pending,
    Assigned,
    Completed,
    Disputed,
    Resolved,
}
```

3. Implement events for job lifecycle
4. Implement access control using Starknet's account abstraction
5. Add escrow functionality using STRK token (ERC20 interface)
6. Implement simple hash-based result attestation
7. Add job timeout and reassignment logic

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for all contract functions with 90%+ coverage
2. Test job submission, assignment, completion, and payment flows
3. Test dispute scenarios and edge cases
4. Test with mock ERC20 tokens
5. Deploy to Starknet testnet and conduct integration tests
6. Perform security review focusing on fund safety and access control

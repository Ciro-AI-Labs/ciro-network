# Task ID: 41
# Title: Advanced Event Processing System Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 31, 35, 39, 26
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement an advanced event processing system that extends the Event Indexer with sophisticated filtering, subscription mechanisms, cross-contract coordination, analytics, real-time streaming, and event-driven automation capabilities.
# Details:
This task involves building a comprehensive event processing system that enhances the existing Event Indexer (Task 31) with advanced capabilities:

1. **Event Filtering and Subscription Mechanisms**:
   - Implement a flexible query language for event filtering based on event metadata, content, and context
   - Create subscription patterns with filter expressions:
   ```cairo
   #[derive(Drop, Serde)]
   struct EventFilter {
       contract_addresses: Option<Array<ContractAddress>>,
       event_names: Option<Array<felt252>>,
       parameter_filters: Option<Array<ParameterFilter>>,
       time_range: Option<TimeRange>,
       block_range: Option<BlockRange>
   }
   
   #[derive(Drop, Serde)]
   struct ParameterFilter {
       parameter_name: felt252,
       operator: FilterOperator, // Enum: Equals, GreaterThan, LessThan, Contains, etc.
       value: felt252
   }
   
   #[derive(Drop, Serde)]
   struct Subscription {
       id: felt252,
       subscriber: ContractAddress,
       filter: EventFilter,
       callback_selector: felt252,
       active: bool,
       max_events: Option<u64>
   }
   ```

2. **Cross-Contract Event Coordination**:
   - Implement an event correlation engine that can identify relationships between events from different contracts
   - Create a pattern matching system for complex event sequences:
   ```cairo
   #[derive(Drop, Serde)]
   struct EventPattern {
       pattern_id: felt252,
       event_sequence: Array<EventFilter>,
       time_window: u64, // Maximum time between first and last event
       action: EventAction
   }
   
   #[derive(Drop, Serde)]
   enum EventAction {
       Notify { recipient: ContractAddress, selector: felt252 },
       Execute { contract: ContractAddress, selector: felt252, calldata: Array<felt252> },
       Emit { event_name: felt252, parameters: Array<felt252> }
   }
   ```

3. **Event Analytics and Metrics**:
   - Implement an on-chain analytics module for aggregating event statistics
   - Create time-series data structures for tracking event patterns:
   ```cairo
   #[derive(Drop, Serde)]
   struct EventMetrics {
       event_name: felt252,
       count: u64,
       first_seen: u64,
       last_seen: u64,
       contract_distribution: LegacyMap<ContractAddress, u64>
   }
   ```
   - Develop off-chain analytics integration with popular data platforms (Dune Analytics, The Graph)

4. **Real-Time Event Streaming**:
   - Implement a WebSocket server for real-time event notifications
   - Create a buffered event delivery system with replay capabilities:
   ```rust
   struct EventStream {
       id: String,
       filter: EventFilter,
       buffer_size: usize,
       connections: Vec<WebSocketConnection>,
       event_buffer: VecDeque<Event>,
   }
   
   impl EventStream {
       fn new(id: String, filter: EventFilter, buffer_size: usize) -> Self { ... }
       fn add_connection(&mut self, conn: WebSocketConnection) { ... }
       fn push_event(&mut self, event: Event) { ... }
       fn replay_events(&self, conn: &WebSocketConnection, from_id: Option<String>) { ... }
   }
   ```

5. **Event-Driven Automation**:
   - Implement a rule engine for automated actions based on event patterns
   - Create a workflow system for complex event-driven processes:
   ```cairo
   #[derive(Drop, Serde)]
   struct AutomationRule {
       rule_id: felt252,
       trigger: EventFilter,
       conditions: Array<Condition>,
       actions: Array<EventAction>,
       enabled: bool,
       execution_count: u64,
       max_executions: Option<u64>
   }
   
   #[derive(Drop, Serde)]
   struct Condition {
       type_: ConditionType,
       parameters: Array<felt252>
   }
   ```

6. **Event Processing Pipelines**:
   - Implement a pipeline architecture for event transformation and enrichment
   - Create pluggable processors for event data:
   ```rust
   trait EventProcessor {
       fn process(&self, event: &Event) -> Result<Vec<Event>, ProcessorError>;
       fn name(&self) -> &str;
       fn description(&self) -> &str;
   }
   
   struct Pipeline {
       id: String,
       processors: Vec<Box<dyn EventProcessor>>,
       error_handler: Box<dyn Fn(Event, ProcessorError)>,
   }
   
   impl Pipeline {
       fn new(id: String) -> Self { ... }
       fn add_processor(&mut self, processor: Box<dyn EventProcessor>) { ... }
       fn process(&self, event: Event) -> Vec<Event> { ... }
   }
   ```

   - Create a caching layer for frequently accessed events
   - Optimize gas usage for on-chain event processing
   - Implement sharding for high-volume event streams

9. **Security and Access Control**:
   - Implement permission systems for event subscription and automation
   - Create audit logging for all event-related actions
   - Implement rate limiting for event subscriptions

10. **Documentation and Examples**:
    - Create comprehensive documentation for the event system
    - Develop example use cases and integration patterns

# Task ID: 9
# Title: Job Routing and Dispatch System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement job routing and dispatching based on worker capabilities and availability.
# Details:
1. Implement job queue with priority support
2. Create job routing algorithm based on worker capabilities
3. Implement job assignment and tracking
4. Add timeout and retry logic
5. Create job status tracking
6. Implement job cancellation
7. Add metrics for job processing
8. Implement job database schema:

```rust
#[derive(sqlx::FromRow)]
struct Job {
    id: String,
    model_id: String,
    inputs: Vec<u8>,
    status: JobStatus,
    worker_id: Option<String>,
    created_at: chrono::DateTime<chrono::Utc>,
    assigned_at: Option<chrono::DateTime<chrono::Utc>>,
    completed_at: Option<chrono::DateTime<chrono::Utc>>,
    result_hash: Option<String>,
    result: Option<Vec<u8>>,
}

#[derive(sqlx::Type)]
enum JobStatus {
    Pending,
    Assigned,
    Processing,
    Completed,
    Failed,
    Cancelled,
}
```

9. Implement job result validation

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for job routing algorithm
2. Integration tests with mock workers
3. Test job assignment and tracking
4. Test timeout and retry logic
5. Benchmark job throughput
6. Test with various job types and sizes

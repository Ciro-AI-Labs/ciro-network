# Task ID: 36
# Title: Comprehensive Testing Suite for CIRO Network Smart Contracts
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 26, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a complete testing suite for all CIRO Network smart contracts with full coverage including unit, integration, performance, security, and end-to-end tests.
# Details:
This task involves creating a comprehensive testing framework for all CIRO Network smart contracts, focusing on complete test coverage and robust verification:

1. **Test Environment Setup**:
   - Configure a dedicated testing environment using Starknet-devnet and Cairo test framework
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline integration for automated test execution
   - Implement test fixtures and helper functions for common testing scenarios
   - Create mock contracts for external dependencies

2. **Unit Tests Implementation**:
   - Implement unit tests for all functions in the following contracts:
     - JobMgr (job submission, escrow, result attestation)
     - CDC Pool (worker registration, staking, rewards)
     - CIRO Token (ERC20 functionality, burn mechanisms, governance)
     - Reputation Manager (scoring, history tracking, thresholds)
     - Task Allocator (job assignment algorithms)
     - Event Indexer (event management, subscriptions)
     - Proof Verifier (verification logic, challenges)
     - Treasury Timelock (governance controls, time locks)
   - Target minimum 95% code coverage for all contracts
   - Test both success and failure paths for all functions

3. **Integration Tests Implementation**:
   - Test cross-contract interactions:
     - JobMgr and CDC Pool for worker assignment
     - Reputation Manager and Task Allocator for reputation-based assignment
     - CIRO Token and Treasury for fee collection and distribution
     - Event Indexer with all contracts for proper event emission
   - Test complete workflows from job submission to completion and payment
   - Test upgrade patterns and proxy implementations

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Implement gas optimization tests to ensure efficient contract execution
   - Test batch operations for scalability (multiple job submissions, worker registrations)
   - Benchmark contract execution times under various load conditions
   - Test contract behavior under network congestion scenarios

5. **Security Testing**:
   - Implement tests for common attack vectors:
     - Reentrancy attacks
     - Front-running vulnerabilities
     - Integer overflow/underflow
     - Access control bypasses
     - Denial of service attacks
   - Test contract behavior under malicious inputs
   - Verify proper access controls for all privileged functions
   - Test economic security (e.g., slashing mechanisms, stake requirements)

6. **End-to-End Testing**:
   - Implement tests for complete user workflows:
     - Job submission, worker assignment, execution, verification, and payment
     - Worker registration, staking, reputation building, and reward claiming
     - Governance proposal creation, voting, and execution
     - Dispute resolution and challenge mechanisms
   - Test contract interactions with off-chain components

7. **Test Documentation**:
   - Document all test cases with clear descriptions of what is being tested
   - Create a test coverage report showing coverage by contract and function
   - Document any known limitations or edge cases not covered by tests

8. **Test Maintenance Plan**:
   - Implement a process for updating tests when contracts are modified
   - Create guidelines for writing tests for new contracts or features
   - Set up monitoring for test quality and coverage metrics

**Implementation Example for JobMgr Unit Tests**:
```cairo
#[test]
fn test_submit_job() {
    // Setup
    let (contract_address, deployer) = deploy_jobmgr();
    let model_id = register_test_model(contract_address, deployer);
    let inputs = array![1, 2, 3];
    let payment = 100;
    
    // Execute
    let job_id = submit_job(contract_address, model_id, inputs, payment);
    
    // Verify
    let job = get_job(contract_address, job_id);
    assert(job.model_id == model_id, 'Wrong model ID');
    assert(job.status == JobStatus::Pending, 'Wrong status');
    assert(job.payment == payment, 'Wrong payment amount');
}

#[test]
fn test_submit_result() {
    // Setup job submission
    let (contract_address, deployer) = deploy_jobmgr();
    let model_id = register_test_model(contract_address, deployer);
    let worker_id = register_test_worker(contract_address);
    let job_id = submit_test_job(contract_address, model_id);
    let result_hash = 0x1234;
    
    // Generate worker signature
    let signature = sign_result(worker_id, job_id, result_hash);
    
    // Execute
    submit_result(contract_address, job_id, result_hash, signature);
    
    // Verify
    let job = get_job(contract_address, job_id);
    assert(job.status == JobStatus::Completed, 'Wrong status');
    assert(job.result_hash == result_hash, 'Wrong result hash');
}
```

**Implementation Example for Integration Tests**:
```cairo
#[test]
fn test_job_assignment_with_reputation() {
    // Deploy contracts
    let (jobmgr_address, _) = deploy_jobmgr();
    let (cdc_pool_address, _) = deploy_cdc_pool();
    let (reputation_address, _) = deploy_reputation_manager();
    let (task_allocator_address, _) = deploy_task_allocator();
    
    // Register workers with different reputation scores
    let worker1 = register_worker(cdc_pool_address, capabilities1);
    let worker2 = register_worker(cdc_pool_address, capabilities2);
    set_reputation(reputation_address, worker1, 80);
    set_reputation(reputation_address, worker2, 50);
    
    // Submit job
    let job_id = submit_job(jobmgr_address, model_id, inputs, payment);
    
    // Trigger allocation
    allocate_job(task_allocator_address, job_id);
    
    // Verify high-reputation worker was selected
    let job = get_job(jobmgr_address, job_id);
    assert(job.assigned_worker == worker1, 'Wrong worker assigned');
}
```

# Test Strategy:
The testing strategy will verify the completeness and effectiveness of the test suite:

1. **Code Coverage Verification**:
   - Use Cairo test coverage tools to verify minimum 95% code coverage across all contracts
   - Review uncovered code paths and add tests to address gaps
   - Generate coverage reports as artifacts for review

2. **Unit Test Verification**:
   - Verify each contract function has dedicated tests for both success and failure paths
   - Run unit tests in isolation to confirm they test specific functionality
   - Verify test assertions properly validate expected outcomes
   - Check that all error conditions and require statements are tested

3. **Integration Test Verification**:
   - Deploy contracts to a local Starknet devnet environment
   - Execute integration tests to verify correct cross-contract interactions
   - Validate that events are properly emitted and captured
   - Verify complete workflows execute as expected

4. **Performance Test Verification**:
   - Measure gas consumption for all contract functions
   - Compare against established baselines to identify regressions
   - Verify batch operations scale efficiently
   - Document performance characteristics for reference

5. **Security Test Verification**:
   - Review security tests with security experts
   - Verify all identified attack vectors are properly tested
   - Conduct manual review of critical security functions
   - Consider engaging external security auditors to validate test approach

6. **End-to-End Test Verification**:
   - Execute complete workflow tests on Starknet testnet
   - Verify all components interact correctly in a production-like environment
   - Test with realistic data volumes and patterns
   - Validate results match expected outcomes

7. **Test Suite Maintenance**:
   - Verify tests run successfully in CI/CD pipeline
   - Confirm test suite execution time is reasonable
   - Check that test failures provide clear error messages
   - Ensure tests are properly documented for future maintenance

8. **Acceptance Criteria**:
   - All tests pass consistently in the CI/CD pipeline
   - Code coverage meets or exceeds 95% target
   - Security tests verify resistance to all identified attack vectors
   - Performance tests confirm contracts meet efficiency requirements
   - Documentation is complete and accurate

# Task ID: 7
# Title: Kafka Integration for Job Intake
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement Kafka consumer in the Coordinator service to receive and parse job requests from the CIRO platform.
# Details:
1. Implement Kafka consumer using rdkafka crate
2. Set up consumer group configuration for load balancing
3. Implement message parsing and validation
4. Create job queue for processing
5. Implement error handling and dead letter queue
6. Add metrics for message processing
7. Implement reconnection logic
8. Create schema for job messages:

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct JobRequest {
    job_id: String,
    model_id: String,
    inputs: Vec<String>,
    priority: JobPriority,
    requester: String,
    max_price: u64,
    callback_topic: String,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
enum JobPriority {
    Low,
    Medium,
    High,
}
```

9. Implement message acknowledgement and commit strategy

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for message parsing and validation
2. Integration tests with local Kafka instance
3. Test error handling and recovery
4. Benchmark message processing throughput
5. Test with various message formats and sizes
6. Verify metrics collection

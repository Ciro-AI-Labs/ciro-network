# Task ID: 40
# Title: Gas and Storage Optimization for Smart Contracts
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 26
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive gas and storage optimizations across all smart contracts to improve cost efficiency and network scalability, focusing on packed storage structures, optimized event emission, and efficient data structures.
# Details:
1. Conduct a thorough gas usage analysis of all existing smart contracts:
   - Use Starknet-specific gas profiling tools to identify hotspots
   - Create baseline metrics for current gas consumption patterns
   - Document storage layout and usage patterns

2. Implement storage packing optimizations:
   - Reorganize storage variables to maximize slot utilization
   - Convert multiple `felt252` variables to packed bit structures where appropriate
   - Implement the following storage packing pattern for JobMgr:
   ```cairo
   struct PackedJobData {
       status: u8,  // Using minimal bits for status enum
       model_id: u32,
       worker_id: u32,
       timestamp: u64,
       // Other fields packed efficiently
   }
   ```

3. Optimize loops and iterations:
   - Replace unbounded loops with bounded iterations where possible
   - Implement early exit conditions for search operations
   - Cache repeated calculations outside of loops
   - Use efficient array operations that minimize gas costs

4. Optimize event emissions:
   - Reduce number of emitted events where possible
   - Optimize event parameter encoding
   - Consider indexed vs non-indexed fields for efficient filtering

5. Implement memory usage optimizations:
   - Minimize temporary variable creation
   - Reuse memory allocations where possible
   - Use appropriate data types to minimize memory footprint

6. Optimize CDC Pool contract:
   - Implement batch processing for reward distributions
   - Optimize worker capability storage
   - Implement efficient slashing mechanisms

7. Optimize CIRO Token contract:
   - Implement efficient burn mechanisms
   - Optimize token transfer operations
   - Implement gas-efficient governance mechanisms

8. Implement efficient data structures:
   - Replace linear searches with mapping-based lookups
   - Use bit manipulation for flags and small enums
   - Implement gas-efficient collection operations

9. Document all optimizations:
   - Create before/after gas usage comparisons
   - Document optimization patterns for future development
   - Create gas usage guidelines for the project

10. Create automated gas usage testing:
    - Implement gas usage assertions in tests
    - Create gas usage benchmarks
    - Implement CI/CD checks for gas regression

# Test Strategy:
1. Establish baseline gas measurements for all contract functions before optimization:
   - Record gas usage for all public functions with various input sizes
   - Document storage costs for different contract states
   - Create gas usage profiles for common user flows

2. Implement comprehensive unit tests for optimized functions:
   - Ensure functional equivalence before and after optimization
   - Test edge cases to verify correctness is maintained
   - Achieve 95%+ test coverage for optimized code

3. Create gas usage comparison tests:
   - Implement automated tests that compare gas usage before and after optimization
   - Set minimum gas reduction thresholds (target 20-30% reduction)
   - Test with realistic workloads and data sizes

4. Perform storage slot analysis:
   - Verify storage slot usage is optimized
   - Test storage read/write operations for gas efficiency
   - Validate storage layout matches design

5. Conduct integration testing:
   - Test optimized contracts with other system components
   - Verify system behavior remains unchanged
   - Test contract interactions for gas efficiency

6. Deploy to Starknet testnet:
   - Measure real-world gas costs on testnet
   - Compare with baseline measurements
   - Identify any testnet-specific optimizations

7. Perform security review of optimizations:
   - Ensure optimizations don't introduce vulnerabilities
   - Verify storage layout changes don't break access controls
   - Check for potential overflow/underflow issues in packed structures

8. Document final gas usage metrics:
   - Create detailed gas usage reports for all functions
   - Document storage costs
   - Provide gas usage guidelines for contract interactions

# Task ID: 42
# Title: Performance Monitoring and Analytics System Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3, 4, 31, 35
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a comprehensive performance monitoring and analytics system for CIRO Network contracts to track gas usage, transaction timing, worker performance, network health, and contract usage statistics.
# Details:
This task involves implementing a multi-layered performance monitoring and analytics system for the CIRO Network:

1. **On-Chain Performance Monitoring**:
   - Implement a `PerformanceMonitorComponent` in `src/utils/performance.cairo` that tracks:
     - Gas usage per contract function call
     - Transaction execution time
     - Contract interaction frequency
     - Worker performance metrics (job completion time, success rate)
     - Network health indicators (TPS, block utilization)
   - Add instrumentation hooks in core contracts (JobMgr, CDC Pool) to emit performance-related events
   - Create a central `MetricsRegistry` contract to aggregate performance data
   - Implement efficient storage patterns for time-series metrics data

2. **Off-Chain Analytics Engine**:
   - Develop a Rust-based analytics service that:
     - Indexes and processes performance events from contracts
     - Calculates performance KPIs and trends
     - Stores historical performance data
     - Provides an API for querying performance metrics
   - Implement data aggregation for different time windows (hourly, daily, weekly)
   - Create anomaly detection algorithms for identifying performance degradation
   - Set up a PostgreSQL database with TimescaleDB extension for time-series data

3. **Performance Dashboards**:
   - Create a React-based dashboard with:
     - Gas usage visualization by contract/function
     - Transaction timing analytics
     - Worker performance leaderboards
     - Network health indicators
     - Contract usage statistics
   - Implement real-time updates using WebSockets
   - Add filtering capabilities by time range, contract, and metric type
   - Create exportable reports for governance and optimization decisions

4. **Alerting System**:
   - Implement alerting for:
     - Abnormal gas usage spikes
     - Slow transaction execution
     - Worker performance degradation
     - Network congestion
     - Contract usage anomalies
   - Create notification channels (email, Discord, Telegram)
   - Implement alert severity levels and escalation policies
   - Add alert acknowledgment and resolution tracking

5. **Performance Optimization Recommendations**:
   - Develop algorithms to identify optimization opportunities
   - Create automated recommendations for gas optimization
   - Implement A/B testing framework for optimization experiments
   - Generate periodic optimization reports

Implementation considerations:
- Use efficient event emission patterns to minimize gas costs of monitoring
- Implement sampling strategies for high-volume metrics
- Design storage-efficient data structures for on-chain metrics
- Ensure monitoring components have minimal impact on main contract functionality
- Implement access controls for sensitive performance data
- Design for scalability as network usage grows

# Test Strategy:
The testing strategy will verify the correctness, performance, and reliability of the monitoring system:

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for the `PerformanceMonitorComponent` with 90%+ code coverage
   - Test all metric collection functions with various input scenarios
   - Verify correct event emission for performance-related events
   - Test data aggregation and calculation functions
   - Validate storage efficiency for time-series data

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test integration with JobMgr and CDC Pool contracts
   - Verify metrics collection during normal contract operation
   - Test the analytics engine's ability to process and store metrics
   - Validate dashboard data accuracy against known test scenarios
   - Test alerting system with simulated performance anomalies

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Measure the gas overhead of performance monitoring instrumentation
   - Benchmark the analytics engine with high volumes of metrics data
   - Test dashboard performance with large datasets
   - Verify system stability under peak load conditions
   - Measure database query performance for different time ranges

4. **End-to-End Testing**:
   - Create test scenarios that generate known performance patterns
   - Verify that dashboards correctly display the expected metrics
   - Test alert generation and notification delivery
   - Validate that optimization recommendations are appropriate
   - Test the complete flow from on-chain event to dashboard visualization

5. **User Acceptance Testing**:
   - Conduct usability testing of dashboards with stakeholders
   - Verify that alerts provide actionable information
   - Test report generation and export functionality
   - Validate that the system provides valuable insights for optimization

6. **Security Testing**:
   - Test access controls for sensitive performance data
   - Verify that monitoring doesn't expose contract vulnerabilities
   - Test API authentication and authorization
   - Validate secure storage of performance metrics

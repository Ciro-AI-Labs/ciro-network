# Task ID: 12
# Title: Worker Docker Container Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement Docker container for CPU-based worker nodes with inference execution capabilities.
# Details:
1. Create Dockerfile for worker container
2. Implement worker service in Rust
3. Add job processing logic
4. Implement result signing and attestation
5. Add health check endpoints
6. Implement metrics collection
7. Create logging and monitoring
8. Add auto-update mechanism

Docker configuration:
```dockerfile
FROM rust:1.70-slim as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN cargo build --release

FROM debian:bullseye-slim
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ca-certificates && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
COPY --from=builder /app/target/release/cdc-worker /usr/local/bin/
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["cdc-worker"]
```

Worker service structure:
```rust
struct WorkerService {
    coordinator_client: CoordinatorClient,
    job_processor: JobProcessor,
    metrics: MetricsCollector,
    wallet: StarknetWallet,
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Build and test Docker container
2. Test job processing with sample jobs
3. Test result signing and attestation
4. Test health check endpoints
5. Test metrics collection
6. Test auto-update mechanism
7. Benchmark container performance

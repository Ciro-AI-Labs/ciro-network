# Task ID: 6
# Title: Coordinator Service Architecture Design
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Design the architecture for the Rust-based Coordinator service that will handle job dispatching, worker management, and on-chain interactions.
# Details:
1. Design the Coordinator service architecture with the following components:
   - Kafka consumer for job intake
   - Worker discovery and management
   - Job dispatcher
   - On-chain transaction manager
   - REST API for status queries

2. Define data models and interfaces
3. Design database schema (PostgreSQL recommended)
4. Plan for scalability and fault tolerance
5. Design authentication and authorization mechanisms
6. Plan for observability (logging, metrics, tracing)
7. Design API endpoints and documentation

Technology stack recommendations:
- Rust 1.70+ with Tokio for async runtime
- Axum or Actix-web for HTTP server
- rdkafka for Kafka integration
- sqlx for database access
- starknet-rs for Starknet interaction
- OpenTelemetry for observability
- Prometheus for metrics
- Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation

# Test Strategy:
1. Review architecture with team
2. Create proof-of-concept for critical components
3. Test Kafka integration with sample messages
4. Validate Starknet interaction with testnet
5. Benchmark performance for expected load
6. Verify fault tolerance design

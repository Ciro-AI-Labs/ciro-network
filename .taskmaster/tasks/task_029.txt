# Task ID: 29
# Title: Reputation Manager Module Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a centralized reputation management system for worker ranking and job allocation in the CIRO Network smart contracts, including scoring algorithms, access controls, and history tracking.
# Details:
1. Implement the ReputationManager contract with the following functions:
   - `initialize_reputation(worker_id: felt252) -> bool`
   - `update_reputation(worker_id: felt252, score_delta: i32, reason: felt252) -> bool`
   - `get_reputation(worker_id: felt252) -> ReputationScore`
   - `get_reputation_history(worker_id: felt252) -> Array<ReputationEvent>`
   - `check_reputation_threshold(worker_id: felt252, threshold: u32) -> bool`
   - `get_worker_rank(worker_id: felt252) -> u32`
   - `get_top_workers(count: u32) -> Array<WorkerRank>`

2. Implement core data structures:
```cairo
struct ReputationScore {
    score: u32,
    level: u8,
    last_updated: u64,
    total_jobs_completed: u32,
    successful_jobs: u32,
}

struct ReputationEvent {
    timestamp: u64,
    score_delta: i32,
    reason: felt252,
    job_id: Option<u256>,
}

struct WorkerRank {
    worker_id: felt252,
    score: u32,
    level: u8,
}
```

3. Implement reputation scoring algorithm:
   - Base score starts at 100 for new workers
   - Successful job completion: +1 to +5 points based on job complexity
   - Failed job: -5 to -20 points based on job importance
   - Slashed worker: -50 points
   - Disputed results: -10 points
   - Implement decay function for inactive workers
   - Define reputation levels (1-5) based on score thresholds

4. Implement reputation-based access controls:
   - Create permission checks for job types based on reputation level
   - Implement minimum reputation thresholds for high-value jobs
   - Add reputation checks to CDC Pool for worker registration

5. Integrate with CDC Pool contract:
   - Add reputation initialization on worker registration
   - Update worker reputation on successful job completion
   - Update reputation on slashing events

6. Integrate with JobMgr contract:
   - Update reputation on job completion
   - Use reputation for job allocation priority
   - Consider reputation in dispute resolution

7. Implement events for reputation changes:
```cairo
#[event]
fn ReputationUpdated(worker_id: felt252, old_score: u32, new_score: u32, reason: felt252) {}

#[event]
fn ReputationLevelChanged(worker_id: felt252, old_level: u8, new_level: u8) {}
```

8. Uncomment and implement the ReputationManager interface in src/lib.cairo:14

9. Add security measures:
   - Only allow authorized contracts (JobMgr, CDC Pool) to update reputation
   - Implement rate limiting for reputation updates
   - Add admin functions for dispute resolution

10. Create comprehensive documentation for the reputation system:
    - Scoring algorithm details
    - Integration points with other contracts
    - Reputation level benefits and requirements

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for all ReputationManager functions with 90%+ coverage:
   - Test initialization of reputation for new workers
   - Test reputation updates with various score deltas
   - Test reputation threshold checking
   - Test worker ranking functionality
   - Test reputation history tracking

2. Test reputation scoring algorithm:
   - Verify correct score calculation for different scenarios
   - Test edge cases (minimum/maximum scores)
   - Test score decay for inactive workers
   - Verify level transitions based on score thresholds

3. Test integration with CDC Pool contract:
   - Verify reputation initialization on worker registration
   - Test reputation updates on slashing events
   - Test reputation checks for worker capabilities

4. Test integration with JobMgr contract:
   - Verify reputation updates on job completion
   - Test reputation-based job allocation
   - Test reputation impact in dispute scenarios

5. Security tests:
   - Verify only authorized contracts can update reputation
   - Test rate limiting for reputation updates
   - Verify admin functions for dispute resolution

6. Deploy to Starknet testnet and conduct integration tests:
   - Test with multiple workers and jobs
   - Verify reputation changes reflect in worker rankings
   - Test reputation-based access controls

7. Performance testing:
   - Benchmark gas costs for reputation updates
   - Test with large numbers of workers and reputation events
   - Optimize storage patterns for reputation history

8. Conduct formal verification of critical reputation functions

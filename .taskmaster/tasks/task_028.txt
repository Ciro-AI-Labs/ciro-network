# Task ID: 28
# Title: Token Vesting & Allocation System Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 4, 5, 26
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a comprehensive token vesting and allocation system with configurable schedules for different stakeholder groups, multi-signature controls, and timelock mechanisms.
# Details:
1. Design and implement the following smart contracts in Cairo 1.0:
   - `TokenVesting`: Core contract for managing vesting schedules with the following features:
     - Linear vesting with configurable cliff periods
     - Support for different vesting schedules per stakeholder group
     - Emergency pause functionality for regulatory compliance
     - Ability to revoke unvested tokens in specific circumstances
   
   - `TokenTimelock`: Contract to lock tokens for a specified period with:
     - Time-based release mechanisms
     - Multi-signature requirements for early release
     - Integration with governance systems

2. Implement the following allocation structure:
   - Team: 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff, linear monthly release
   - Advisors: 3-year vesting with 6-month cliff, linear monthly release
   - Private Sale: 2-year vesting with 3-month cliff, linear monthly release
   - Seed Round: 18-month vesting with 1-month cliff, linear monthly release
   - Foundation: 5-year vesting with 6-month cliff, linear quarterly release
   - Ecosystem: 4-year vesting with no cliff, linear monthly release
   - Development: 3-year vesting with 3-month cliff, linear monthly release

3. Implement multi-signature functionality:
   - Require 3-of-5 signatures for administrative actions
   - Implement role-based access control for different operations
   - Create separate multi-sig for emergency functions

4. Implement upgrade safety mechanisms:
   - Proxy pattern for contract upgradeability
   - Timelock for upgrade proposals (minimum 72 hours)
   - Governance approval requirements for upgrades

5. Create comprehensive events for all operations:
```cairo
#[event]
fn VestingScheduleCreated(
    beneficiary: ContractAddress,
    amount: u256,
    start_time: u64,
    cliff_duration: u64,
    duration: u64,
    slice_period_seconds: u64,
    revocable: bool,
    group: felt252
);

#[event]
fn TokensReleased(beneficiary: ContractAddress, amount: u256);

#[event]
fn VestingRevoked(beneficiary: ContractAddress, refund_amount: u256);
```

6. Implement the following core functions:
```cairo
fn create_vesting_schedule(
    beneficiary: ContractAddress,
    amount: u256,
    cliff_duration: u64,
    duration: u64,
    slice_period_seconds: u64,
    revocable: bool,
    group: felt252
) -> bool;

fn release() -> u256;

fn revoke(beneficiary: ContractAddress) -> bool;

fn get_releasable_amount(beneficiary: ContractAddress) -> u256;

fn get_vesting_schedule(beneficiary: ContractAddress) -> VestingSchedule;
```

7. Implement comprehensive security measures:
   - Reentrancy protection
   - Integer overflow/underflow protection
   - Access control with proper authorization checks
   - Emergency pause functionality
   - Rate limiting for sensitive operations

8. Create a dashboard interface for:
   - Monitoring vesting schedules
   - Tracking token releases
   - Managing multi-sig operations
   - Viewing allocation statistics

9. Implement integration with the CIRO Token contract:
   - Token transfer mechanisms
   - Approval workflows
   - Balance tracking

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit testing:
   - Write comprehensive unit tests for all contract functions with 100% coverage
   - Test each vesting schedule type with different parameters
   - Test edge cases (zero amounts, past dates, maximum values)
   - Test revocation scenarios and emergency functions
   - Test multi-signature operations with various signer combinations

2. Integration testing:
   - Test integration with CIRO Token contract
   - Test interaction between vesting and timelock contracts
   - Verify correct token transfers during vesting events
   - Test upgrade mechanisms and proxy patterns

3. Security testing:
   - Conduct formal verification of critical functions
   - Perform static analysis using security tools
   - Test for common vulnerabilities (reentrancy, front-running)
   - Conduct fuzzing tests with random inputs
   - Verify access control restrictions

4. Scenario testing:
   - Simulate complete vesting cycles for each stakeholder group
   - Test early termination scenarios
   - Test regulatory compliance scenarios
   - Verify correct behavior during market stress conditions

5. Deployment testing:
   - Deploy to Starknet testnet and verify all functions
   - Test with realistic token amounts and timeframes
   - Verify gas costs and optimization
   - Test contract verification on Starkscan

6. Audit preparation:
   - Document all test cases and results
   - Prepare security model documentation
   - Create audit readiness checklist
   - Address any identified issues before external audit

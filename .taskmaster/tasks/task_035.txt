# Task ID: 35
# Title: Implement Missing Utility Components in src/utils/mod.cairo
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the missing utility components referenced in src/utils/mod.cairo including ContractRegistryComponent, ProxyComponent, EventBusComponent, CircuitBreakerComponent, MultiSigComponent, and ReputationComponent.
# Details:
This task involves implementing the following utility components that are currently imported but not implemented:

1. **ContractRegistryComponent**:
   - Implement a central registry for tracking all deployed contracts in the CIRO Network
   - Create functions for registering, updating, and querying contract addresses
   - Include versioning support for contract upgrades
   - Implement access control to restrict who can update registry entries

2. **ProxyComponent**:
   - Implement proxy pattern for contract upgradeability following OpenZeppelin standards
   - Create functions for upgrading implementation contracts
   - Implement storage layout management to prevent storage collisions
   - Add proper access controls for upgrade functionality
   - Example implementation:
   ```cairo
   #[starknet::component]
   mod ProxyComponent {
       use starknet::ContractAddress;
       
       #[storage]
       struct Storage {
           implementation_address: ContractAddress,
           admin: ContractAddress,
       }
       
       #[event]
       #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
       enum Event {
           Upgraded: Upgraded,
           AdminChanged: AdminChanged,
       }
       
       #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
       struct Upgraded {
           implementation: ContractAddress,
       }
       
       #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)]
       struct AdminChanged {
           previous_admin: ContractAddress,
           new_admin: ContractAddress,
       }
       
       // Function implementations...
   }
   ```

3. **EventBusComponent**:
   - Implement a centralized event bus for cross-contract communication
   - Create functions for publishing and subscribing to events
   - Implement event filtering and routing mechanisms
   - Add support for delayed and scheduled events

4. **CircuitBreakerComponent**:
   - Implement emergency pause functionality for critical contract operations
   - Create functions to pause/unpause specific contract functions
   - Add tiered access control for different emergency scenarios
   - Implement automatic circuit breaking based on predefined conditions
   - Include logging and notification mechanisms

5. **MultiSigComponent**:
   - Implement multi-signature functionality for critical operations
   - Create proposal, approval, and execution workflow
   - Add support for configurable thresholds and timeouts
   - Implement member management (add/remove signers)
   - Include transaction batching capabilities

6. **ReputationComponent**:
   - Implement a reputation scoring system for worker nodes
   - Create functions for updating reputation scores based on job performance
   - Add support for reputation-based job routing and rewards
   - Implement decay mechanisms for reputation over time
   - Include anti-gaming measures to prevent manipulation

For each component:
- Follow Cairo 1.0 component pattern best practices
- Ensure proper error handling and input validation
- Add comprehensive events for all state changes
- Include detailed comments explaining the purpose and usage of each function
- Optimize for gas efficiency where possible
- Ensure compatibility with existing contract architecture

Integration considerations:
- Ensure these components can be easily imported and used by other contracts
- Maintain consistent interfaces across components
- Consider interactions between components (e.g., MultiSig controlling CircuitBreaker)
- Follow the principle of least privilege for all access controls

# Test Strategy:
1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Write comprehensive unit tests for each component with 90%+ code coverage
   - Test all public functions with various input combinations
   - Test edge cases and error conditions
   - Verify events are emitted correctly
   - Test access control restrictions

2. **Component-Specific Testing**:
   - **ContractRegistryComponent**:
     - Test registration, updating, and querying of contract addresses
     - Verify version tracking works correctly
     - Test access control restrictions

   - **ProxyComponent**:
     - Test successful upgrades to new implementation contracts
     - Verify storage layout is preserved during upgrades
     - Test access control for upgrade functionality
     - Test delegate calls work correctly

   - **EventBusComponent**:
     - Test event publishing and subscription mechanisms
     - Verify event routing works correctly
     - Test filtering capabilities
     - Benchmark performance with high event volumes

   - **CircuitBreakerComponent**:
     - Test pausing and unpausing functionality
     - Verify tiered access controls work correctly
     - Test automatic circuit breaking conditions
     - Verify affected functions are properly restricted when paused

   - **MultiSigComponent**:
     - Test proposal, approval, and execution workflow
     - Verify threshold requirements are enforced
     - Test member management functions
     - Verify transaction batching works correctly

   - **ReputationComponent**:
     - Test reputation score updates
     - Verify decay mechanisms work as expected
     - Test anti-gaming measures
     - Verify integration with job routing

3. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test interactions between components
   - Verify components work correctly when imported into other contracts
   - Test with realistic usage scenarios

4. **Security Testing**:
   - Conduct security review focusing on access control
   - Test for reentrancy vulnerabilities
   - Verify proper validation of all inputs
   - Check for potential front-running vulnerabilities

5. **Deployment Testing**:
   - Deploy components to Starknet testnet
   - Verify components work correctly in a deployed environment
   - Test gas costs and optimize if necessary

6. **Documentation Verification**:
   - Verify all functions are properly documented
   - Ensure usage examples are accurate
   - Confirm error messages are clear and helpful

# Task ID: 34
# Title: Proof Verifier Contract Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 13, 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the Proof Verifier smart contract in Cairo for ZK proof verification, supporting multiple proof types, priority levels, and worker reputation integration based on the interface in src/interfaces/proof_verifier.cairo.
# Details:
1. Implement the Proof Verifier contract based on the interface in src/interfaces/proof_verifier.cairo (332 lines), with the following components:

2. Implement core verification functions:
   - `verify_proof(proof_id: u256, proof_data: Array<felt252>, worker_signature: Array<felt252>) -> bool`
   - `submit_proof_job(proof_type: ProofType, inputs: Array<felt252>, priority: u8, deadline: u64) -> proof_id: u256`
   - `get_proof_status(proof_id: u256) -> ProofStatus`
   - `challenge_proof(proof_id: u256, counter_proof: Array<felt252>) -> bool`
   - `claim_verification_reward(proof_id: u256)`

3. Implement the following proof job types:
```cairo
enum ProofType {
    StarknetBatch: u8,
    ZKMLInference: u8,
    CrossChainBridge: u8,
    ApplicationSpecific: u8,
}
```

4. Implement priority levels for time-critical operations:
```cairo
struct PriorityConfig {
    level: u8,
    reward_multiplier: u16,
    max_verification_time: u64,
}
```

5. Integrate with worker reputation system:
```cairo
struct WorkerReputation {
    worker_id: felt252,
    successful_verifications: u64,
    challenged_verifications: u64,
    average_verification_time: u64,
    reputation_score: u16,
}

fn update_worker_reputation(worker_id: felt252, proof_id: u256, success: bool) {
    // Update worker reputation based on verification success/failure
}
```

6. Implement proof verification algorithms for each proof type:
   - Starknet batch proofs: Verify STARK proofs for batched Starknet transactions
   - ZKML inference verification: Verify ML model inference correctness
   - Cross-chain bridge proofs: Verify state transitions across different blockchains
   - Application-specific proofs: Extensible framework for custom proof verification

7. Implement proof job queue and assignment logic:
```cairo
struct ProofJob {
    id: u256,
    proof_type: ProofType,
    inputs: Array<felt252>,
    priority: u8,
    deadline: u64,
    status: ProofStatus,
    assigned_worker: Option<felt252>,
    submission_time: u64,
    verification_time: Option<u64>,
}

fn assign_proof_job(job_id: u256, worker_id: felt252) {
    // Assign proof job to worker based on reputation and capabilities
}
```

8. Implement reward distribution based on proof complexity and priority:
```cairo
fn calculate_reward(proof_id: u256) -> u256 {
    // Calculate reward based on proof type, priority, and verification time
}
```

9. Add events for proof lifecycle:
```cairo
#[event]
fn ProofJobSubmitted(proof_id: u256, proof_type: ProofType, priority: u8, deadline: u64) {}

#[event]
fn ProofVerified(proof_id: u256, worker_id: felt252, verification_time: u64) {}

#[event]
fn ProofChallenged(proof_id: u256, challenger: felt252, success: bool) {}

#[event]
fn RewardClaimed(proof_id: u256, worker_id: felt252, amount: u256) {}
```

10. Implement security measures:
    - Proof timeout handling
    - Slashing for incorrect verifications
    - Dispute resolution mechanism
    - Rate limiting for proof submissions

11. Optimize gas usage for on-chain verification operations
    - Batch verification where possible
    - Efficient storage patterns
    - Minimize state changes

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for all contract functions with 95%+ coverage:
   - Test each verification function with valid and invalid inputs
   - Test proof job submission with different types and priorities
   - Test challenge mechanism with valid and invalid challenges
   - Test reward calculation and distribution

2. Test specific proof type verification:
   - Test Starknet batch proof verification with sample proofs
   - Test ZKML inference verification with different model outputs
   - Test cross-chain bridge proofs with mock bridge states
   - Test application-specific proofs with custom verification logic

3. Integration tests with other contracts:
   - Test integration with CDC Pool contract for worker reputation
   - Test integration with JobMgr contract for job assignment
   - Test with mock ERC20 tokens for reward distribution

4. Security testing:
   - Test timeout handling for proof verification
   - Test slashing mechanism for incorrect verifications
   - Test dispute resolution with various scenarios
   - Perform formal verification of critical functions

5. Performance testing:
   - Benchmark gas costs for different proof types
   - Test with varying proof sizes and complexities
   - Measure verification time for different proof types
   - Test system under high load conditions

6. Deploy to Starknet testnet:
   - Deploy contract to testnet and verify functionality
   - Test with real-world proof examples
   - Conduct end-to-end verification flows
   - Validate event emissions and state changes

7. Conduct security audit:
   - Review for potential vulnerabilities
   - Check for reentrancy issues
   - Verify access control mechanisms
   - Test for edge cases in proof verification

8. Documentation and verification:
   - Document all functions and their expected behavior
   - Create test scenarios for each proof type
   - Document gas optimization techniques
   - Verify interface compliance with src/interfaces/proof_verifier.cairo

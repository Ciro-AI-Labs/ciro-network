# Task ID: 31
# Title: Event Indexer and Management System Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 26, 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a comprehensive event management system for CIRO Network contracts including centralized event bus, filtering mechanisms, cross-contract event coordination, and off-chain event indexing integration.
# Details:
1. Implement an Event Aggregator smart contract in Cairo 1.0 with the following functionality:
   - Event registration from authorized contracts
   - Event categorization and tagging
   - Cross-contract event correlation
   - Subscription management for dApps and services

2. Create the event data structures:
```cairo
#[derive(Drop, Serde)]
struct EventMetadata {
    contract_address: ContractAddress,
    event_name: felt252,
    timestamp: u64,
    block_number: u64,
    transaction_hash: felt252
}

#[derive(Drop, Serde)]
struct IndexedEvent {
    metadata: EventMetadata,
    topics: Array<felt252>,
    data: Array<felt252>
}
```

3. Implement core event aggregator functions:
```cairo
#[external]
fn register_event_source(contract_address: ContractAddress, event_types: Array<felt252>) -> bool;

#[external]
fn emit_indexed_event(event: IndexedEvent);

#[external]
fn subscribe_to_events(subscriber: ContractAddress, event_filters: Array<EventFilter>) -> u256;

#[view]
fn get_events_by_filter(filter: EventFilter, page: u32, page_size: u32) -> Array<IndexedEvent>;
```

4. Develop an off-chain indexing service using:
   - Apibara or Starknet Indexer for event ingestion
   - PostgreSQL with JSONB columns for efficient event storage
   - Redis for caching frequently accessed events
   - GraphQL API for flexible querying

5. Implement the indexing service with:
   - Event normalization and transformation pipeline
   - Real-time indexing with configurable confirmation depth
   - Historical event backfilling capabilities
   - Fault tolerance and recovery mechanisms
   - Horizontal scaling support

6. Create a query API layer with:
   - RESTful endpoints for common queries
   - GraphQL interface for complex queries
   - WebSocket support for real-time event subscriptions
   - Authentication and rate limiting
   - Pagination and filtering options

7. Develop an event analytics dashboard:
   - Event volume metrics and visualizations
   - Contract activity monitoring
   - Custom event search and filtering
   - Event correlation analysis
   - Anomaly detection for security monitoring

8. Implement integration with existing CIRO contracts:
   - Add event emission to JobMgr contract
   - Add event emission to CDC Pool contract
   - Add event emission to CIRO Token contract
   - Create event listeners for cross-contract coordination

9. Create documentation:
   - Event schema reference
   - API documentation
   - Integration guides for dApp developers
   - Dashboard user guide

10. Deploy and configure:
    - Set up CI/CD pipeline for indexer service
    - Configure monitoring and alerting
    - Implement backup and disaster recovery
    - Set up staging and production environments

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test the Event Aggregator contract:
   - Test event registration functionality
   - Test event emission and indexing
   - Test subscription management
   - Test access controls and permissions
   - Verify gas optimization for high-volume events

2. Integration test the contract with other CIRO contracts:
   - Test event emission from JobMgr contract
   - Test event emission from CDC Pool contract
   - Test event emission from CIRO Token contract
   - Verify cross-contract event correlation

3. Test the off-chain indexing service:
   - Verify correct event ingestion from Starknet
   - Test event transformation and normalization
   - Benchmark indexing performance under load
   - Test fault tolerance with simulated failures
   - Verify data consistency between chain and index

4. Test the query API:
   - Verify REST API endpoints return correct data
   - Test GraphQL query functionality
   - Benchmark API performance under load
   - Test WebSocket subscription functionality
   - Verify authentication and rate limiting

5. Test the analytics dashboard:
   - Verify metrics accuracy
   - Test filtering and search functionality
   - Test responsiveness and usability
   - Verify data visualization accuracy

6. End-to-end testing:
   - Deploy to Starknet testnet
   - Generate test events from various contracts
   - Verify complete pipeline from event emission to dashboard display
   - Test system under simulated production load

7. Security testing:
   - Conduct smart contract security audit
   - Test API security and access controls
   - Verify data integrity throughout the system
   - Test for common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)

8. Performance testing:
   - Benchmark event indexing throughput
   - Test system with high event volume
   - Measure query response times under load
   - Verify scalability with increased event volume

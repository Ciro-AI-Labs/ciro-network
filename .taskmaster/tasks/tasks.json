However, the deployment attempt to testnet failed at the declaration step. Potential issues include:\n\n1. **RPC Connection Issues**:\n   - Connection to the Starknet testnet RPC endpoint may be unstable or timing out\n   - May need to switch to an alternative RPC provider or increase timeout settings\n\n2. **Keystore Access Problems**:\n   - The deployment script may not have proper access to the keystore file\n   - Permissions on the keystore file may need adjustment\n   - The keystore password may be incorrect or not properly provided\n\n3. **Contract Already Declared**:\n   - The contract class hash may already exist on the testnet\n   - Need to check if the contract was partially deployed in a previous attempt\n   - May need to use a different deployment approach for already-declared contracts\n\n4. **Network Configuration**:\n   - The deployment script may be targeting the wrong network\n   - Network configuration parameters may need adjustment\n\n### Next Steps for Deployment\n\n1. Check RPC endpoint status and connection:\n   ```bash\n   curl -X POST https://alpha4.starknet.io/feeder_gateway/get_block?blockNumber=latest\n   ```\n\n2. Verify keystore access and permissions:\n   ```bash\n   ls -la CIRO_Network_Backup/20250711_061352/testnet_keystore.json\n   chmod 600 CIRO_Network_Backup/20250711_061352/testnet_keystore.json\n   ```\n\n3. Check if contract is already declared:\n   ```bash\n   starkli class-hash-at <address> --rpc https://alpha4.starknet.io\n   ```\n\n4. Modify deployment script to handle already-declared contracts:\n   ```bash\n   # Add to deploy_reputation_manager.sh\n   if starkli class-hash-at <address> --rpc $RPC_URL &> /dev/null; then\n     echo \"Contract already declared, proceeding to deployment...\"\n     # Skip declaration step\n   else\n     # Proceed with declaration\n     starkli declare ...\n   fi\n   ```\n\nThe implementation itself is complete and working as expected based on all test results. Only the deployment process needs troubleshooting.\n</info added on 2025-07-30T14:22:45.123Z>",

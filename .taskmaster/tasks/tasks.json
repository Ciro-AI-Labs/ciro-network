Implement the following allocation structure:\n   - Team: 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff, linear monthly release\n   - Advisors: 3-year vesting with 6-month cliff, linear monthly release\n   - Private Sale: 2-year vesting with 3-month cliff, linear monthly release\n   - Seed Round: 18-month vesting with 1-month cliff, linear monthly release\n   - Foundation: 5-year vesting with 6-month cliff, linear quarterly release\n   - Ecosystem: 4-year vesting with no cliff, linear monthly release\n   - Development: 3-year vesting with 3-month cliff, linear monthly release\n\n3. Implement multi-signature functionality:\n   - Require 3-of-5 signatures for administrative actions\n   - Implement role-based access control for different operations\n   - Create separate multi-sig for emergency functions\n\n4. Implement upgrade safety mechanisms:\n   - Proxy pattern for contract upgradeability\n   - Timelock for upgrade proposals (minimum 72 hours)\n   - Governance approval requirements for upgrades\n\n5. Create comprehensive events for all operations:\n```cairo\n#[event]\nfn VestingScheduleCreated(\n    beneficiary: ContractAddress,\n    amount: u256,\n    start_time: u64,\n    cliff_duration: u64,\n    duration: u64,\n    slice_period_seconds: u64,\n    revocable: bool,\n    group: felt252\n);\n\n#[event]\nfn TokensReleased(beneficiary: ContractAddress, amount: u256);\n\n#[event]\nfn VestingRevoked(beneficiary: ContractAddress, refund_amount: u256);\n```\n\n6. Implement the following core functions:\n```cairo\nfn create_vesting_schedule(\n    beneficiary: ContractAddress,\n    amount: u256,\n    cliff_duration: u64,\n    duration: u64,\n    slice_period_seconds: u64,\n    revocable: bool,\n    group: felt252\n) -> bool;\n\nfn release() -> u256;\n\nfn revoke(beneficiary: ContractAddress) -> bool;\n\nfn get_releasable_amount(beneficiary: ContractAddress) -> u256;\n\nfn get_vesting_schedule(beneficiary: ContractAddress) -> VestingSchedule;\n```\n\n7. Implement comprehensive security measures:\n   - Reentrancy protection\n   - Integer overflow/underflow protection\n   - Access control with proper authorization checks\n   - Emergency pause functionality\n   - Rate limiting for sensitive operations\n\n8. Create a dashboard interface for:\n   - Monitoring vesting schedules\n   - Tracking token releases\n   - Managing multi-sig operations\n   - Viewing allocation statistics\n\n9. Implement integration with the CIRO Token contract:\n   - Token transfer mechanisms\n   - Approval workflows\n   - Balance tracking",
        "testStrategy": "1. Unit testing:\n   - Write comprehensive unit tests for all contract functions with 100% coverage\n   - Test each vesting schedule type with different parameters\n   - Test edge cases (zero amounts, past dates, maximum values)\n   - Test revocation scenarios and emergency functions\n   - Test multi-signature operations with various signer combinations\n\n2. Integration testing:\n   - Test integration with CIRO Token contract\n   - Test interaction between vesting and timelock contracts\n   - Verify correct token transfers during vesting events\n   - Test upgrade mechanisms and proxy patterns\n\n3. Security testing:\n   - Conduct formal verification of critical functions\n   - Perform static analysis using security tools\n   - Test for common vulnerabilities (reentrancy, front-running)\n   - Conduct fuzzing tests with random inputs\n   - Verify access control restrictions\n\n4. Scenario testing:\n   - Simulate complete vesting cycles for each stakeholder group\n   - Test early termination scenarios\n   - Test regulatory compliance scenarios\n   - Verify correct behavior during market stress conditions\n\n5. Deployment testing:\n   - Deploy to Starknet testnet and verify all functions\n   - Test with realistic token amounts and timeframes\n   - Verify gas costs and optimization\n   - Test contract verification on Starkscan\n\n6. Audit preparation:\n   - Document all test cases and results\n   - Prepare security model documentation\n   - Create audit readiness checklist\n   - Address any identified issues before external audit",

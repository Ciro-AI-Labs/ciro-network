# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Worker Registration Module [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the data structures and functions for worker registration in the CDC Pool contract
### Details:
Implement a worker registration system that stores worker addresses, their capabilities, and registration status. Include functions for workers to register, update their capabilities, and deregister. Define appropriate events for registration activities. Ensure proper access control for registration functions.
<info added on 2025-07-07T02:25:18.290Z>
Based on the contract integration analysis, we need to ensure our worker registration system aligns with the existing contract ecosystem:

The worker registration system must be designed to support the 8-tier worker system (Basic $100 → Institutional $500K) defined in the CIRO Token Contract. Implementation should include storage for worker addresses, capabilities, registration status, and tier information.

Key integration points to implement:
- `get_worker_tier(worker)` function to support JobMgr's tier-based job allocation
- `get_tier_allocation_score(worker, requirements)` for worker scoring in job assignments
- `get_worker_capabilities(worker)` to track and verify worker skills
- `get_worker_tier_benefits(tier)` to calculate tier-specific benefits

The registration system must maintain compatibility with the ICDCPool and ICDCPoolDispatcher interfaces already referenced in the CIRO and JobMgr contracts. All function signatures must exactly match those expected by the JobMgr contract to ensure seamless integration.

Include proper event emission for registration activities to support system monitoring and frontend integration.

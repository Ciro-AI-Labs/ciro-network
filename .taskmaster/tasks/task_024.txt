# Task ID: 24
# Title: Performance Testing and Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10, 11, 14, 16, 19
# Priority: high
# Description: Conduct performance testing and optimization for the CDC system to meet performance requirements.
# Details:
1. Define performance test scenarios
2. Set up performance testing environment
3. Implement load testing for:
   - Job submission and processing
   - Worker registration and discovery
   - API endpoints
   - Smart contract interactions
4. Analyze performance bottlenecks
5. Implement optimizations:
   - Database query optimization
   - Caching strategies
   - Connection pooling
   - Asynchronous processing
   - Load balancing
6. Retest after optimizations
7. Document performance characteristics

Performance requirements to validate:
- Job submission latency: <200ms
- Inference completion: <30s for standard models
- Network uptime: >99.9%
- Transaction finality: <10 minutes
- API response time: <100ms for 95th percentile
- Worker discovery time: <1s
- System should handle Phase 1 targets: 10 concurrent workers, 100 jobs/hour

# Test Strategy:
1. Use k6 or similar for load testing
2. Set up monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
3. Test with simulated production load
4. Measure key performance indicators
5. Identify and address bottlenecks
6. Verify performance meets requirements
7. Document performance test results

# Why BSL 1.1 for CIRO Network? 

## üéØ **TL;DR**

CIRO Network uses **Business Source License (BSL) 1.1** for core smart contracts with a **4-year timer to Apache 2.0**. This protects our IP moat while guaranteeing eventual full open source‚Äîthe same approach used by Uniswap v3 on Starknet.

## ü§ù **Our Commitment to Open Source**

**We ARE going open source.** On **January 1, 2029**, all CIRO core contracts automatically become **Apache 2.0** licensed. This date is immutable and will be recorded on-chain for transparency.

**Already open source today:**
- SDKs and developer tools (Apache 2.0)
- Documentation and examples (CC BY 4.0)  
- Client libraries and integrations (MIT/Apache 2.0)

## üõ°Ô∏è **Why We Need BSL Protection**

### **The Reality of Web3 Competition**
Without time-boxed protection, competitors could:
- Fork CIRO on day 1 and launch "CIRO-Lite" 
- Copy our proprietary tokenomics algorithms
- Undercut our network before we establish token flywheel effects
- Free-ride on R&D while we fund continued development

### **Precedent in Starknet Ecosystem**
- **Uniswap v3** successfully used BSL 1.1 on Starknet (2-year protection)
- **Community accepted** the approach when value was delivered
- **No friction** with Starknet Foundation or ecosystem grants
- **Clear path** to full open source maintained trust

## ‚öñÔ∏è **What BSL Means for Different Users**

| User Type | What You Can Do | What You Cannot Do |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Researchers & Academics** | ‚úÖ Study, modify, test, publish papers | ‚ùå Launch commercial competing networks |
| **Developers & Builders** | ‚úÖ Integrate via our Apache-licensed SDKs | ‚ùå Fork core contracts for commercial use |
| **Small Organizations** | ‚úÖ Use freely if <$1M annual revenue | ‚ùå Large-scale commercial deployment |
| **Contributors** | ‚úÖ Submit PRs, earn bug bounties, join team | ‚ùå Fork to create competing business |

## üîÑ **Why Not Other Licenses?**

| License | Why Not for CIRO |
|---------|------------------|
| **MIT/Apache 2.0** | No IP protection ‚Üí day-1 forks kill incentive to innovate |
| **GPL v3** | Copyleft viral effects ‚Üí enterprises won't touch it |
| **AGPL v3** | Most corporate policies ban AGPL ‚Üí kills adoption |
| **Proprietary** | No transparency ‚Üí breaks blockchain trust model |

## üåü **What This Enables for CIRO**

### **Network Effects Protection**
- 4 years to build liquidity and user base
- Token holders benefit from protection during growth phase
- Enterprise partnerships possible during moat period

### **Sustainable Innovation**
- Revenue to fund continued R&D and security audits
- Incentive alignment for long-term protocol development
- Professional support and enterprise solutions

### **Community Trust**
- Guaranteed open source future (not just promises)
- Transparent timeline everyone can verify
- Alignment with Starknet ecosystem values

## ü§ù **For Enterprise Partners**

**Worried about BSL?** Consider:
- **Apache-licensed SDKs** for all integration needs
- **Clear Apache migration path** in 4 years
- **Commercial licensing available** for early enterprise needs
- **Support contracts** available regardless of license

## üìû **Community FAQ**

**Q: Is this really open source?**
A: BSL is "source available" today, "open source" in 2029. It's a time-delayed open source strategy.

**Q: Can I contribute?**
A: Yes! All contributions welcome. Contributors need to sign our CLA.

**Q: What if CIRO disappears?**
A: The license automatically converts to Apache 2.0 on the specified date regardless.

**Q: Why not shorter protection?**
A: 4 years allows sufficient time to establish network effects and sustainable tokenomics.

**Our Promise**: CIRO Network will be fully open source by 2029. BSL 1.1 protects our ability to innovate and deliver value during the critical early years while maintaining our commitment to eventual full openness.

*"Innovation needs protection to flourish, but openness needs guarantees to earn trust."*

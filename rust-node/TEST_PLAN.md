## Test Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Unit Tests
1. Fix remaining compilation errors
2. Implement basic unit tests for each component
3. Ensure all components compile and run
4. Validate basic functionality

### Phase 2: Integration Tests
1. Set up test environment with mock components
2. Implement end-to-end job lifecycle tests
3. Test component interactions
4. Validate error handling

### Phase 3: Performance & Security
1. Implement load testing framework
2. Add security validation tests
3. Performance benchmarking
4. Security audit

### Phase 4: Production Readiness
1. Deployment automation
2. Monitoring setup
3. Operational procedures
4. Production validation

## Test Environment Setup

### Local Development
```bash
# Build and test locally
cargo build
cargo test

# Run specific test suites
cargo test --test coordinator_tests
cargo test --test integration_tests
cargo test --test performance_tests
```

### Docker Environment
```bash
# Build test containers
docker build -t ciro-coordinator-test .

# Run integration tests
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --abort-on-container-exit
```

### Kubernetes Environment
```bash
# Deploy test environment
kubectl apply -f k8s/test-environment/

# Run tests
kubectl exec -it test-runner -- cargo test
```

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix remaining compilation errors
2. **Short-term**: Implement basic unit tests
3. **Medium-term**: Add integration tests
4. **Long-term**: Performance and security testing

## Notes

- All tests should be automated and run in CI/CD pipeline
- Test data should be realistic but not production data
- Performance tests should be run in isolated environments
- Security tests should be run by qualified security professionals
